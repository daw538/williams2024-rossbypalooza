  abstract = {Measuring the abundances of carbon and oxygen in exoplanet atmospheres is considered a crucial avenue for unlocking the formation and evolution of exoplanetary systems. Access to an exoplanet's chemical inventory requires high-precision observations, often inferred from individual molecular detections with low-resolution space-based and high-resolution ground-based facilities. Here we report the medium-resolution (R\$\textbackslash sim\$600) transmission spectrum of an exoplanet atmosphere between 3-5 \$\textbackslash mu\$m covering multiple absorption features for the Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39b, obtained with JWST NIRSpec G395H. Our observations achieve 1.46x photon precision, providing an average transit depth uncertainty of 221 ppm per spectroscopic bin, and present minimal impacts from systematic effects. We detect significant absorption from CO\$\_2\$ (28.5\$\textbackslash sigma\$) and H\$\_2\$O (21.5\$\textbackslash sigma\$), and identify SO\$\_2\$ as the source of absorption at 4.1 \$\textbackslash mu\$m (4.8\$\textbackslash sigma\$). Best-fit atmospheric models range between 3 and 10x solar metallicity, with sub-solar to solar C/O ratios. These results, including the detection of SO\$\_2\$, underscore the importance of characterising the chemistry in exoplanet atmospheres, and showcase NIRSpec G395H as an excellent mode for time series observations over this critical wavelength range.},

  abstract = {What can we say about changes in the hydrologic cycle on 50-year timescales when we cannot predict rainfall next week? Eventually, perhaps, a great deal: the overall climate response to increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases may prove much simpler and more predictable than the chaos of short-term weather. Quantifying the diversity of possible responses is essential for any objective, probability-based climate forecast, and this task will require a new generation of climate modelling experiments, systematically exploring the range of model behaviour that is consistent with observations. It will be substantially harder to quantify the range of possible changes in the hydrologic cycle than in global-mean temperature, both because the observations are less complete and because the physical constraints are weaker.},

  abstract = {To study the complexity of hot Jupiter atmospheres revealed by observations of increasing quality, we have adapted the UK Met Office Global Circulation Model (GCM), the Unified Model (UM), to these exoplanets. The UM solves the full 3D Navier-Stokes equations with a height-varying gravity, avoiding the simplifications used in most GCMs currently applied to exoplanets. In this work we present the coupling of the UM dynamical core to an accurate radiation scheme based on the two-stream approximation and correlated-k method with state-of-the-art opacities from ExoMol. Our first application of this model is devoted to the extensively studied hot Jupiter HD 209458b. We have derived synthetic emission spectra and phase curves, and compare them to both previous models also based on state-of-the-art radiative transfer, and to observations. We find a reasonable agreement between observations and both our days side emission and hot spot offset, however, our night side emissions is too large. Overall our results are qualitatively similar to those found by Showman et al. (2009, ApJ, 699, 564) with the SPARC/MITgcm, however, we note several quantitative differences: Our simulations show significant variation in the position of the hottest part of the atmosphere with pressure, as expected from simple timescale arguments, and in contrast to the "vertical coherency" found by Showman et al. (2009). We also see significant quantitative differences in calculated synthetic observations. Our comparisons strengthen the need for detailed intercomparisons of dynamical cores, radiation schemes and post-processing tools to understand these differences. This effort is necessary in order to make robust conclusions about these atmospheres based on GCM results.},

  abstract = {Abstract The configuration and performance of a new global atmosphere and land model for climate research developed at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) are presented. The atmosphere model, known as AM2, includes a new gridpoint dynamical core, a prognostic cloud scheme, and a multispecies aerosol climatology, as well as components from previous models used at GFDL. The land model, known as LM2, includes soil sensible and latent heat storage, groundwater storage, and stomatal resistance. The performance of the coupled model AM2\textendash LM2 is evaluated with a series of prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) simulations. Particular focus is given to the model's climatology and the characteristics of interannual variability related to E1 Ni\~no\textendash{} Southern Oscillation (ENSO). One AM2\textendash LM2 integration was performed according to the prescriptions of the second Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP II) and data were submitted to the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI). Particular strengths of AM2\textendash LM2, as judged by comparison to other models participating in AMIP II, include its circulation and distributions of precipitation. Prominent problems of AM2\textendash{} LM2 include a cold bias to surface and tropospheric temperatures, weak tropical cyclone activity, and weak tropical intraseasonal activity associated with the Madden\textendash Julian oscillation. An ensemble of 10 AM2\textendash LM2 integrations with observed SSTs for the second half of the twentieth century permits a statistically reliable assessment of the model's response to ENSO. In general, AM2\textendash LM2 produces a realistic simulation of the anomalies in tropical precipitation and extratropical circulation that are associated with ENSO.},

  abstract = {We have developed an observational scheme for the detection and discrimination of Mars atmospheric H2O and CO2 clouds using ground-based instruments in the near infrared. We report the results of our cloud detection and characterization study using Mars near IR images obtained during the 1990 and 1993 oppositions. We focused on specific wavelengths that have the potential, based on previous laboratory studies of H2O and CO2 ices, of yielding the greatest degree of cloud detectability and compositional discriminability. We have detected and mapped absorption features at some of these wavelengths in both the northern and southern polar regions of Mars. Compositional information on the nature of these absorption features was derived from comparisons with laboratory ice spectra and with a simplified radiative transfer model of a CO2 ice cloud overlying a bright surface. Our results indicate that both H2O and CO2 ices can be detected and distinguished in the polar hood clouds. The region near 3.00 {$\mu$}m is most useful for the detection of water ice clouds because there is a strong H2O ice absorption at this wavelength but only a weak CO2 ice band. The region near 3.33 {$\mu$}m is most useful for the detection of CO2 ice clouds because there is a strong, relatively narrow CO2 ice band at this wavelength but only broad ``continuum'' H2O ice absorption. Weaker features near 2.30 {$\mu$}m could arise from CO2 ice at coarse grain sizes, or surface/dust minerals. Narrow features near 2.00 {$\mu$}m, which could potentially be very diagnostic of CO2 ice clouds, suffer from contamination by Mars atmospheric CO2 absorptions and are difficult to interpret because of the rather poor knowledge of surface elevation at high latitudes. These results indicate that future ground-based, Earth-orbital, and spacecraft studies over a more extended span of the seasonal cycle should yield substantial information on the style and timing of volatile transport on Mars, as well as a more detailed understanding of the role of CO2 condensation in the polar heat budget.},

Distributions of the characteristics of the planetary candidates are separated into five class sizes: 68 candidates of approximately Earth-size (R p {$<$} 1.25 R {$\oplus$}), 288 super-Earth-size (1.25 R {$\oplus$} {$<$}= R p {$<$} 2 R {$\oplus$}), 662 Neptune-size (2 R {$\oplus$} {$<$}= R p {$<$} 6 R {$\oplus$}), 165 Jupiter-size (6 R {$\oplus$} {$<$}= R p {$<$} 15 R {$\oplus$}), and 19 up to twice the size of Jupiter (15 R {$\oplus$} {$<$}= R p {$<$} 22 R {$\oplus$}). In the temperature range appropriate for the habitable zone, 54 candidates are found with sizes ranging from Earth-size to larger than that of Jupiter. Six are less than twice the size of the Earth. Over 74\% of the planetary candidates are smaller than Neptune. The observed number versus size distribution of planetary candidates increases to a peak at two to three times the Earth-size and then declines inversely proportional to the area of the candidate. Our current best estimates of the intrinsic frequencies of planetary candidates, after correcting for geometric and sensitivity biases, are 5\% for Earth-size candidates, 8\% for super-Earth-size candidates, 18\% for Neptune-size candidates, 2\% for Jupiter-size candidates, and 0.1\% for very large candidates; a total of 0.34 candidates per star.

We provide the first analysis in terms of star-dependent instellation flux, which allows us to track HZ planets. We define {$\eta\oplus$} as the HZ occurrence of planets with radii between 0.5 and 1.5 R{$\oplus$} orbiting stars with effective temperatures between 4800 and 6300 K. We find that {$\eta\oplus$} for the conservative HZ is between (errors reflect 68\% credible intervals) and planets per star, while the optimistic HZ occurrence is between and planets per star. These bounds reflect two extreme assumptions about the extrapolation of completeness beyond orbital periods where DR25 completeness data are available. The large uncertainties are due to the small number of detected small HZ planets. We find similar occurrence rates between using Poisson likelihood Bayesian analysis and using Approximate Bayesian Computation. Our results are corrected for catalog completeness and reliability. Both completeness and the planet occurrence rate are dependent on stellar effective temperature. We also present occurrence rates for various stellar populations and planet size ranges. We estimate with 95\% confidence that, on average, the nearest HZ planet around G and K dwarfs is {$\sim$}6 pc away and there are {$\sim$}4 HZ rocky planets around G and K dwarfs within 10 pc of the Sun.},

A key step in the confirmation process of these candidates is ruling out false positives through vetting. Vetting also eases the burden on follow-up observations, provides input for demographics studies, and facilitates training machine learning algorithms. Here, we present the TESS Triple-9 (TT9) catalog \textendash{} a uniformly vetted catalog containing dispositions for 999 exoplanet candidates listed on ExoFOP-TESS, known as TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs). The TT9 was produced using the Discovery And Vetting of Exoplanets pipeline, dave, and utilizing the power of citizen science as a part of the Planet Patrol project. More than 70~per\,cent of the TOIs listed in the TT9 pass our diagnostic tests, and are thus marked as true planet candidates. We flagged 144 candidates as false positives, and identified 146 as potential false positives. At the time of writing, the TT9 catalog contains \$\textbackslash sim 20\{\{\textbackslash{} \textbackslash rm per\textbackslash{} cent\}\}\$ of the entire ExoFOP-TESS TOIs list, demonstrates the synergy between automated tools and citizen science, and represents the first stage of our efforts to vet all TOIs.

  abstract = {Cloud feedback\textemdash the change in top-of-atmosphere radiative flux resulting from the cloud response to warming\textemdash constitutes by far the largest source of uncertainty in the climate response to CO2 forcing simulated by global climate models (GCMs). We review the main mechanisms for cloud feedbacks, and discuss their representation in climate models and the sources of intermodel spread. Global-mean cloud feedback in GCMs results from three main effects: (1) rising free-tropospheric clouds (a positive longwave effect); (2) decreasing tropical low cloud amount (a positive shortwave [SW] effect); (3) increasing high-latitude low cloud optical depth (a negative SW effect). These cloud responses simulated by GCMs are qualitatively supported by theory, high-resolution modeling, and observations. Rising high clouds are consistent with the fixed anvil temperature (FAT) hypothesis, whereby enhanced upper-tropospheric radiative cooling causes anvil cloud tops to remain at a nearly fixed temperature as the atmosphere warms. Tropical low cloud amount decreases are driven by a delicate balance between the effects of vertical turbulent fluxes, radiative cooling, large-scale subsidence, and lower-tropospheric stability on the boundary-layer moisture budget. High-latitude low cloud optical depth increases are dominated by phase changes in mixed-phase clouds. The causes of intermodel spread in cloud feedback are discussed, focusing particularly on the role of unresolved parameterized processes such as cloud microphysics, turbulence, and convection.

It is found that for each latitude, through all rotation rates, the jet spacing scales with the Rhines scale. These simulations show the presence of a ``supercriticality latitude'' within the baroclinic zone, where poleward (equatorward) of this latitude, the Rhines scale is larger (smaller) than the Rossby deformation radius. Poleward of this latitude, a classic geostrophic turbulence picture appears with a - spectral slope of inverse cascade from the deformation radius up to the Rhines scale. A shallower slope than the -3 slope of enstrophy cascade is found from the deformation radius down to the viscosity scale as a result of the broad input of baroclinic eddy kinetic energy. At these latitudes, eddy\textendash eddy interactions transfer barotropic eddy kinetic energy from the input scales of baroclinic eddy kinetic energy up to the jet scale and down to smaller scales. For the Earth case, this latitude is outside the baroclinic zone and therefore an inverse cascade does not appear. Equatorward of the supercriticality latitude, the - slope of inverse cascade vanishes, eddy\textendash mean flow interactions play an important role in the balance, and the spectrum follows a -3 slope from the Rhines scale down to smaller scales, similar to what is observed on Earth. Moreover, the length scale of the energy-containing zonal wavenumber is equal to (larger than) the jet scale poleward (equatorward) of the supercriticality latitude.},

  abstract = {Poleward migration of eddy-driven jets is found to occur in the extratropics when the subtropical and eddy-driven jets are clearly separated, as achieved by simulations at high-rotation rates. The poleward migration of these eddy-driven baroclinic jets over time is consistent with variation of eddy momentum flux convergence and baroclinicity across the width of the jet. We demonstrate this using a high-resolution idealized GCM where we systematically examine the eddy-driven jets over a wide range of rotation rates (up to 16 times the rotation rate of Earth). At the flanks of the jets, the poleward migration is caused by a poleward bias in baroclinicity across the width of the jet, estimated through measures such as Eady growth rate and supercriticality. The poleward biased baroclinicity is due to the meridional variation of the Coriolis parameter, which causes a poleward bias of the eddy momentum flux convergence. At the core of the jets, the poleward biased eddy momentum flux convergence relative to the mean jet deflects over time the baroclinicity and the jets poleward. As the rotation rate is increased, and more (narrower) jets emerge the migration rate becomes smaller due to less eddy momentum flux convergence over the narrower baroclinic zones. We find a linear relation between the migration rate of the jets and the net eddy momentum flux convergence across the jets. This poleward migration might be related to the slow poleward propagation of temporal anomalies of zonal winds observed in the upper troposphere.},

Simulations show that the turbulent evolution in the spherical domain is strongly dependent on numerical and physical conditions. The independent effects of (1) (hyper)dissipation and initial spectrum, (2) rotation rate, and (3) Rossby deformation radius are carefully isolated and studied in detail. In the nondivergent and nonrotating case, an initially turbulent flow evolves into a vorticity quadrupole at long times, a direct consequence of angular momentum conservation. In the presence of sufficiently strong rotation, the nondivergent long-time behavior yields a field dominated by polar vortices\textemdash as previously reported by Yoden and Yamada. In contrast, the case with a finite deformation radius (i.e., the full spherical shallow-water system) spontaneously evolves toward a banded configuration, the number of bands increasing with the rotation rate. A direct application of this shallow-water model to the Jovian atmosphere is discussed. Using standard values for the planetary radius and rotation, we show how the initially turbulent flow self-organizes into a potential vorticity field containing zonal structures, where regions of steep potential vorticity gradients (jets) separate relatively homogenized bands. Moreover, Jovian parameter values in our simulations lead to a strong vorticity asymmetry, favoring anticyclonic vortices\textemdash in further agreement with observations.},

Some of the first observations of these planets will consist of disc-averaged, time-resolved broadband photometry. To simulate such data, the Deep Impact spacecraft obtained light curves of Earth at seven wavebands spanning 300\textendash 1000 nm as part of the EPOXI mission of opportunity. In this paper, we analyze disc-integrated light curves, treating Earth as if it were an exoplanet, to determine if we can detect the presence of oceans and continents. We present two observations each spanning 1 day, taken at gibbous phases of 57\textdegree{} and 77\textdegree, respectively. As expected, the time-averaged spectrum of Earth is blue at short wavelengths due to Rayleigh scattering, and gray redward of 600 nm due to reflective clouds. The rotation of the planet leads to diurnal albedo variations of 15\%\textendash 30\%, with the largest relative changes occurring at the reddest wavelengths. To characterize these variations in an unbiased manner, we carry out a principal component analysis of the multi-band light curves; this analysis reveals that 98\% of the diurnal color changes of Earth are due to only two dominant eigencolors. We use the time variations of these two eigencolors to construct longitudinal maps of the Earth, treating it as a non-uniform Lambert sphere. We find that the spectral and spatial distributions of the eigencolors correspond to cloud-free continents and oceans despite the fact that our observations were taken on days with typical cloud cover. We also find that the near-infrared wavebands are particularly useful in distinguishing between land and water. Based on this experiment, we conclude that it should be possible to infer the existence of water oceans on exoplanets with time-resolved broadband observations taken by a large space-based coronagraphic telescope.},

            Atmospheric heat transport is an important piece of our climate system, yet we lack a complete theory for its magnitude or changes. Atmospheric dynamics and radiation play different roles in controlling the total atmospheric heat transport (AHT) and its partitioning into components associated with eddies and mean meridional circulations. This work focuses on two specific controls: a radiative one, namely atmospheric radiative temperature tendencies, and a dynamic one, the planetary rotation rate. We use an idealized gray radiation model to employ a novel framework to lock the radiative temperature tendency and total AHT to climatological values, even while the rotation rate is varied. This setup allows for a systematic study of the effects of radiative tendency and rotation rate on AHT. We find that rotation rate controls the latitudinal extent of the Hadley cell and the heat transport efficiency of eddies. Both the rotation rate and radiative tendency influence the strength of the Hadley cell and the strength of equator–pole energy differences that are important for AHT by eddies. These two controls do not always operate independently and can reinforce or dampen each other. In addition, we examine how individual AHT components, which vary with latitude, sum to a total AHT that varies smoothly with latitude. At slow rotation rates the mean meridional circulation is most important in ensuring total AHT varies smoothly with latitude, while eddies are most important at rotation rates similar to, and faster than, those of Earth.},

  abstract = {The effect of ocean mixed layer depth on climate is explored in a suite of slab ocean aquaplanet simulations with different mixed layer depths ranging from a globally uniform value of 50\textendash 2.4 m. In addition to the expected increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle in temperature with decreasing ocean mixed layer depth, the simulated climates differ in several less intuitive ways including fundamental changes in the annual mean climate. The phase of seasonal cycle in temperature differs non-monotonically with increasing ocean mixed layer depth, reaching a maximum in the 12 m slab depth simulation. This result is a consequence of the change in the source of the seasonal heating of the atmosphere across the suite of simulations. In the shallow ocean runs, the seasonal heating of the atmosphere is dominated by the surface energy fluxes whereas the seasonal heating is dominated by direct shortwave absorption within the atmospheric column in the deep ocean runs. The surface fluxes are increasingly lagged with respect to the insolation as the ocean deepens which accounts for the increase in phase lag from the shallow to mid-depth runs. The direct shortwave absorption is in phase with insolation, and thus the total heating comes back in phase with the insolation as the ocean deepens more and the direct shortwave absorption dominates the seasonal heating of the atmosphere. The intertropical convergence zone follows the seasonally varying insolation and maximum sea surface temperatures into the summer hemisphere in the shallow ocean runs whereas it stays fairly close to the equator in the deep ocean runs. As a consequence, the tropical precipitation and region of high planetary albedo is spread more broadly across the low latitudes in the shallow runs, resulting in an apparent expansion of the tropics relative to the deep ocean runs. As a result, the global and annual mean planetary albedo is substantially (20~\%) higher in the shallow ocean simulations which results in a colder (7C) global and annual mean surface temperature. The increased tropical planetary albedo in the shallow ocean simulations also results in a decreased equator-to-pole gradient in absorbed shortwave radiation and drives a severely reduced ({$\approx$}50~\%) meridional energy transport relative to the deep ocean runs. As a result, the atmospheric eddies are weakened and shifted poleward (away from the high albedo tropics) and the eddy driven jet is also reduced and shifted poleward by 15\textdegree{} relative to the deep ocean run.},

  abstract = {By obtaining complete solutions, satisfying all the relevant simultaneous differential equations and boundary conditions, representing small disturbances of simple states of steady baroclinic large-scale atmospheric motion it is shown that these simple states of motion are almost invariably unstable. An arbitrary disturbance (corresponding to some inhomogeneity of an actual system) may be regarded as analysed into {$\geq$}components{$\leq$} of a certain simple type, some of which grow exponentially with time. In all the cases examined there exists one particular component which grows faster than any other. It is shown how, by a process analogous to {$\geq$}natural selection{$\leq$}, this component becomes dominant in that almost any disturbance tends eventually to a definite size, structure and growth-rate (and to a characteristic life-history after the disturbance has ceased to be {$\geq$}small{$\leq$}), which depends only on the broad characteristics of the initial (unperturbed) system. The characteristic disturbances (forms of breakdown) of certain types of initial system (approximating to those observed in practice) are identified as the ideal forms of the observed cyclonc waves and long waves of middle and high latitudes. The implications regarding the ultimate limitations of weather forecasting are discussed.},

It is argued that at infrared wavelengths the two-stream equations are best viewed as an approximation to the differential radiance, the difference between the actual radiance and the local isotropic Planckian radiance. In this formulation the diffusivity factor and the forward- and backward-scattering fractions are related to the differential radiance. By considering the corresponding differential fluxes, approximate methods for representing overlapping gaseous absorption are derived. These methods offer substantial savings in computing time compared to an explicit representation of the overlap.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive new radiation code based on the two-stream equations in both the long-wave and short-wave spectral regions is described. The spectral resolution of the code is variable, enabling it to be used in a wide range of applications. Because of its flexibility, the code is well-suited to the investigation of the sensitivity of radiative calculations to changes in the way in which physical processes are parametrized. The gaseous transmission data are derived from a line-by-line model. Particular attention is directed towards the treatment of the water vapour continuum, the overlap between gases, and the sensitivity to changing the carbon dioxide concentrations. The performance of the code is examined both at high spectral resolution and in a lower-resolution configuration designed for the UK Meteorological Office Unified Forecast/Climate Model (UM). Particularly for use in the UM, the code must be shown to perform satisfactorily across the whole range of atmospheric conditions. Comparisons are therefore made with reference calculations in both the long-wave and the short-wave, in clear and cloudy skies, and the accuracy with which various processes may be represented is studied. For the cloudy calculations in the short-wave, a new method is presented for deriving the single-scattering properties in broad bands, based on the analytic expression for the reflectivity of an optically thick cloud. This minimizes the errors in calculating the short-wave radiative properties of water clouds when the spectral resolution is reduced to that designed for the UM. In contrast, for ice clouds the errors are minimized by deriving the single-scattering properties using linear averaging, as appropriate for optically thin clouds. In the long-wave, the vertical distribution of the radiative heating in cirrus clouds is examined at high spectral resolution. The effect of scattering of long-wave radiation, usually ignored in large-scale models, is examined in some detail and is explained using a simple model. Taking all these studies into account, it is concluded that the configuration designed for the UM retains the generality of the code, without significantly compromising the overall accuracy.},

  abstract = {Abstract The authors study a wide range of atmospheric circulations with an idealized moist general circulation model to evaluate the mechanisms controlling intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) migrations. They employ a zonally symmetric aquaplanet slab ocean of fixed depth and force top-of-atmosphere insolation to remain fixed at the pole for an ``eternal solstice'' simulation and also vary seasonally for a range of rotation rates, keeping all other parameters Earth-like. For rotation rates {$\Omega$}E/8 and slower, a transient maximum in zonal-mean precipitation appears at the summer pole; however, the ITCZ associated with the ascending branch of the Hadley circulation lies at \textasciitilde 60\textdegree. The authors assess how widely used predictors of the ITCZ position perform in this wide parameter space. Standard predictors based on different estimates of the Hadley cell's poleward extent are correlated with but overestimate off-equatorial ITCZ locations. Interestingly, in the eternal-solstice case for Earth's rotation rate, the ITCZ remains at subtropical latitudes even though the lower-level moist static energy maximizes at the summer pole. While seemingly at odds with convective quasi-equilibrium arguments, this can happen because at Earth's rotation rates, the thermal stratification set in convective regions can only be communicated within the tropics, where temperature gradients are constrained to be weak. The authors therefore develop an understanding of the ITCZ's position based on top-of-atmosphere energetics and the boundary layer momentum budget and argue that friction and pressure gradient forces determine the region of maximum convergence, offering a modified dynamical perspective on the monsoon-like seasonal weather patterns of terrestrial planets.},

  abstract = {The question of climate at high obliquity is raised in the context of both exoplanet studies (e.g. habitability) and paleoclimates studies (evidence for low-latitude glaciation during the Neoproterozoic and the ``Snowball Earth'' hypothesis). States of high obliquity, {$\phi$}, are distinctive in that, for {$\phi\geqslant$}54\textdegree, the poles receive more solar radiation in the annual mean than the equator, opposite to the present day situation. In addition, the seasonal cycle of insolation is extreme, with the poles alternatively ``facing'' the Sun and sheltering in the dark for months. The novelty of our approach is to consider the role of a dynamical ocean in controlling the surface climate at high obliquity, which in turn requires understanding of the surface winds patterns when temperature gradients are reversed. To address these questions, a coupled ocean\textendash atmosphere\textendash sea ice GCM configured on an Aquaplanet is employed. Except for the absence of topography and modified obliquity, the set-up is Earth-like. Two large obliquities {$\phi$}, 54\textdegree{} and 90\textdegree, are compared to today's Earth value, {$\phi$}=23.5\textdegree. Three key results emerge at high obliquity: (1) despite reversed temperature gradients, mid-latitudes surface winds are westerly and trade winds exist at the equator (as for {$\phi$}=23.5\textdegree ) although the westerlies are confined to the summer hemisphere, (2) a habitable planet is possible with mid-latitude temperatures in the range 300\textendash 280K and (3) a stable climate state with an ice cap limited to the equatorial region is unlikely. We clarify the dynamics behind these features (notably by an analysis of the potential vorticity structure and conditions for baroclinic instability of the atmosphere). Interestingly, we find that the absence of a stable partially glaciated state is critically linked to the absence of ocean heat transport during winter, a feature ultimately traced back to the high seasonality of baroclinic instability conditions in the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Abstract In this paper, a simplified moist general circulation model is developed and used to study changes in the atmospheric general circulation as the water vapor content of the atmosphere is altered. The key elements of the model physics are gray radiative transfer, in which water vapor and other constituents have no effect on radiative fluxes, a simple diffusive boundary layer with prognostic depth, and a mixed layer aquaplanet surface boundary condition. This GCM can be integrated stably without a convection parameterization, with large-scale condensation only, and this study focuses on this simplest version of the model. These simplifications provide a useful framework in which to focus on the interplay between latent heat release and large-scale dynamics. In this paper, the authors study the role of moisture in determining the tropospheric static stability and midlatitude eddy scale. In a companion paper, the effects of moisture on energy transports by baroclinic eddies are discussed. The authors vary a parameter in the Clausius\textendash Clapeyron relation to control the amount of water in the atmosphere, and consider circulations ranging from the dry limit to 10 times a control value. The typical length scale of midlatitude eddies is found to be remarkably insensitive to the amount of moisture in the atmosphere in this model. The Rhines scale evaluated at the latitude of the maximum eddy kinetic energy fits the model results for the eddy scale well. Moist convection is important in determining the extratropical lapse rate, and the dry stability is significantly increased with increased moisture content.},

  abstract = {Abstract In this paper, the effect of a simple convection scheme on the zonally averaged tropical general circulation is examined within an idealized moist GCM to obtain broad classifications of the influence of convection on the Tropics. This is accomplished with a simplified convection scheme in the style of Betts and Miller. The scheme is utilized in a moist GCM with simplified physical parameterizations (gray radiation, with zonally symmetric, slab mixed layer ocean boundary conditions). Comparisons are made with simulations without a convection scheme [i.e., with large-scale condensation (LSC) only], with the moist convective adjustment (MCA) parameterization, and with various formulations and parameter sets with a simplified Betts\textendash Miller (SBM) scheme. With the control run using the SBM scheme, the Tropics become quieter and less dependent on horizontal resolution as compared with the LSC or MCA simulations. The Hadley circulation mass transport is significantly reduced with the SBM scheme, as is the ITCZ precipitation. An important factor determining this behavior is the parameterization of shallow convection: without shallow convection, the convection scheme is largely ineffective at preventing convection from occurring at the grid scale. The sensitivities to convection scheme parameters are also examined. The simulations are remarkably insensitive to the convective relaxation time, and only mildly sensitive to the relative humidity of the reference profile, provided significant large-scale condensation is not allowed to occur. The changes in the zonally averaged tropical circulation that occur in all the simulations are understood based on the convective criteria of the schemes and the gross moist stability of the atmosphere.},

Aquaplanet, fixed sea surface temperature lower boundary conditions are used in both models to study the response of the Hadley cell width to changes in both global mean temperature and pole-to-equator temperature gradient. The primary sensitivity of both models is a large expansion of the Hadley cell with increased mean temperature. The models also exhibit a smaller increase in width with temperature gradient. The Hadley cell widths agree well with a scaling theory by Held which assumes that the width is determined by the latitude where baroclinic eddies begin to occur. As surface temperatures are warmed, the latitude of baroclinic instability onset is shifted poleward due to increases in the static stability of the subtropics, which is increased in an atmosphere with higher moisture content.},

A substantial decrease in the annual rate of growth of grain production in the last decade (to a value of less than 1 per cent from the 2.7 per cent prevailing until the 1990s) suggests that self-sufficiency in foodgrains may not be sustained without changes in strategies. A significant finding is the observed asymmetry in the response to monsoon variation, with the magnitude of the impact of deficit rainfall on GDP and grain production being larger than the impact of surplus rainfall. We find that despite a substantial decrease in the contribution of agriculture to GDP over the five decades, the impact of severe droughts has remained between 2 and 5 per cent of GDP throughout. We have suggested that a possible reason for the relatively low response of grain production to average or above average monsoon rainfall post-1980 is that the strategies which would allow farmers to reap benefits of the rainfall in good monsoon years are not economically viable in the current milieu. The experience of the monsoon season of 2006 suggests that losses due to floods, caused in part by the sudden release of the water stored in the reservoirs of dams may be another important factor.},

Dynamical feedbacks appear to accelerate the transition. This study investigates the relevance of this behavior to monsoon onset by using primitive equation model simulations ranging from aquaplanets to more realistic configurations with Earth's continents and topography. A change in the relationship between ITCZ latitude and overturning strength is identified once the ITCZ moves poleward of approximately 7\textdegree. Monsoon onset is associated with off-equatorial ascent in regions of nonnegligible planetary vorticity, and this is found to generate a vortex stretching tendency that reduces upper-level absolute vorticity. In an aquaplanet, this causes a transition to the cross-equatorial, thermally direct regime, intensifying the overturning circulation. Analysis of the zonal momentum budget suggests that a stationary wave, driven by topography and land\textendash sea contrast, can trigger a similar transition in the more realistic model configuration, with the wave extending the ascent region of the Southern Hemisphere Hadley cell northward, and enhanced overturning then developing to the south. These two elements of the circulation resemble the East and South Asian monsoons.},

  abstract = {Abstract Aquaplanets with low-heat-capacity slab-ocean boundary conditions can exhibit rapid changes in the regime of the overturning circulation over the seasonal cycle, which have been connected to the onset of Earth's monsoons. In spring, as the ITCZ migrates off the equator, it jumps poleward and a sudden transition occurs from an eddy-driven, equinoctial regime with two weak Hadley cells, to a near-angular-momentum-conserving, solstitial regime with a strong, cross-equatorial winter-hemisphere cell. Here, the controls on the transition latitude and rate are explored in idealized moist aquaplanet simulations. It is found that the transition remains rapid relative to the solar forcing when year length and slab-ocean heat capacity are varied, and, at Earth's rotation rate, always occurs when the ITCZ reaches approximately 7\textdegree. This transition latitude is, however, found to scale inversely with rotation rate. Interestingly, the transition rate varies nonmonotonically with rotation, with a maximum at Earth's rotation rate, suggesting that Earth may be particularly disposed to a fast monsoon onset. The fast transition relates to feedbacks in both the atmosphere and the slab ocean. In particular, an evaporative feedback between the lower-level branch of the overturning circulation and the surface temperature is identified. This accelerates monsoon onset and slows withdrawal. Last, comparing eddy-permitting and axisymmetric experiments shows that, in contrast with results from dry models, in this fully moist model the presence of eddies slows the migration of the ITCZ between hemispheres.},

TOI-700 lies in the TESS continuous viewing zone in the Southern Ecliptic Hemisphere; observations spanning 11 sectors reveal three planets with radii ranging from 1 R{$\oplus$} to 2.6 R{$\oplus$} and orbital periods ranging from 9.98 to 37.43 days. Ground-based follow-up combined with diagnostic vetting and validation tests enables us to rule out common astrophysical false-positive scenarios and validate the system of planets. The outermost planet, TOI-700 d, has a radius of 1.19 {$\pm$} 0.11 R{$\oplus$} and resides within a conservative estimate of the host star's habitable zone, where it receives a flux from its star that is approximately 86\% of Earth's insolation. In contrast to some other low-mass stars that host Earth-sized planets in their habitable zones, TOI-700 exhibits low levels of stellar activity, presenting a valuable opportunity to study potentially rocky planets over a wide range of conditions affecting atmospheric escape. While atmospheric characterization of TOI-700 d with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be challenging, the larger sub-Neptune, TOI-700 c (R = 2.63 R{$\oplus$}), will be an excellent target for JWST and future space-based observatories. TESS is scheduled to once again observe the Southern Hemisphere, and it will monitor TOI-700 for an additional 11 sectors in its extended mission. These observations should allow further constraints on the known planet parameters and searches for additional planets and transit timing variations in the system.},

The solar system terrestrial atmospheres, Venus, Earth, Mars, and Titan, exhibit a large variety in the strength, width, and seasonality of their Hadley circulation. Despite the Hadley cell being thermally driven, in all planets, the ascending branch does not coincide with the warmest latitude, even in cases with very long seasonality (e.g., Titan) or very small thermal inertia (e.g., Mars). In order to understand the characteristics of the Hadley circulation in cases of extreme planetary characteristics, we show both theoretically, using axisymmetric theory, and numerically, using a set of idealized GCM simulations, that the thermal Rossby number dictates the character of the circulation. Given the possible variation of thermal Rossby number parameters, the rotation rate is found to be the most critical factor controlling the circulation characteristics. The results also explain the location of the Hadley cell ascending branch on Mars and Titan.},

  abstract = {Thousands of exoplanets have been detected to date, and with future planned missions this tally will increase. Understanding the climate dependence on the planetary parameters is vital for the study of terrestrial exoplanet habitability. Using an idealized general circulation model with a seasonal cycle, we study the seasonal response of the surface temperature and Hadley circulation to changes in the orbital, rotational, and radiative timescales. Analyzing the climate's seasonal response to variations in these timescales, we find a regime transition between planets controlled by the annual mean insolation to planets controlled by the seasonal variability depending on the relation between the length of the orbital period, obliquity, and radiative timescale. Consequently, planets with obliquity greater than 54\textdegree{} and a short orbital period will have a minimum surface temperature at the equator. We also show that in specific configurations, mainly high atmospheric mass and short orbital periods, high obliquity planets can still have an equable climate. Based on the model results, we suggest an empirical power law for the ascending and descending branches of the Hadley circulation and its strength. These power laws show that the Hadley circulation becomes wider and stronger by increasing the obliquity and orbital period or by decreasing the atmospheric mass and rotation rate. Consistent with previous studies, we show that the rotation rate plays an essential role in dictating the width of the seasonally dependent Hadley circulation.},

This study uses a general circulation model and an energy balance model (EBM) to assess the parameters that govern the seasonal cycle. We define two metrics to describe the seasonal cycle, {$\phi$}s, the latitudinal shift of the maximum temperature, and {$\Delta$}T, the maximum seasonal temperature variation amplitude. We show that alongside the expected dependence on the obliquity and orbital period, where seasonality generally strengthens with an increase in these parameters, the seasonality depends in a nontrivial way on the rotation rate. While the seasonal amplitude decreases as the rotation rate slows down, the latitudinal shift, {$\phi$}s, shifts poleward. A similar result occurs in a diffusive EBM with increasing diffusivity. These results suggest that the influence of the rotation rate on the seasonal cycle stems from the effect of the rotation rate on the atmospheric heat transport.},

  abstract = {Clouds are one of the most influential components of Earth's climate system. Specifically, the midlatitude clouds play a vital role in shaping Earth's albedo. This study investigates the connection between baroclinic activity, which dominates the midlatitude climate, and cloud-albedo and how it relates to Earth's existing hemispheric albedo symmetry. We show that baroclinic activity and cloud-albedo are highly correlated. By using Lagrangian tracking of cyclones and anticyclones and analyzing their individual cloud properties at different vertical levels, we explain why their cloud-albedo increases monotonically with intensity. We find that while for anticyclones, the relation between strength and cloudiness is mostly linear, for cyclones, in which clouds are more prevalent, the relation saturates with strength. Using the cloud-albedo strength relationships and the climatology of baroclinic activity, we demonstrate that the observed hemispheric difference in cloud-albedo is well explained by the difference in the population of cyclones and anticyclones, which counter-balances the difference in clear-sky albedo. Finally, we discuss the robustness of the hemispheric albedo symmetry in the future climate. Seemingly, the symmetry should break, as the northern hemisphere's storm track response differs from that of the southern hemisphere due to Arctic amplification. However, we show that the saturation of the cloud response to storm intensity implies that the increase in the skewness of the southern hemisphere storm distribution toward strong storms will decrease future cloud-albedo in the southern hemisphere. This complex response explains how albedo symmetry might persist even with the predicted asymmetric hemispheric change in baroclinicity under climate change.},

  abstract = {Tidally locked exoplanets likely host global atmospheric circulations with a superrotating equatorial jet, planetary-scale stationary waves, and thermally driven overturning circulation. In this work, we show that each of these features can be separated from the total circulation by using a Helmholtz decomposition, which splits the circulation into rotational (divergence-free) and divergent (vorticity-free) components. This technique is applied to the simulated circulation of a terrestrial planet and a gaseous hot Jupiter. For both planets, the rotational component comprises the equatorial jet and stationary waves, and the divergent component contains the overturning circulation. Separating out each component allows us to evaluate their spatial structure and relative contribution to the total flow. In contrast with previous work, we show that divergent velocities are not negligible when compared with rotational velocities and that divergent, overturning circulation takes the form of a single, roughly isotropic cell that ascends on the day side and descends on the night side. These conclusions are drawn for both the terrestrial case and the hot Jupiter. To illustrate the utility of the Helmholtz decomposition for studying atmospheric processes, we compute the contribution of each of the circulation components to heat transport from day side to night side. Surprisingly, we find that the divergent circulation dominates day\textendash night heat transport in the terrestrial case and accounts for around half of the heat transport for the hot Jupiter. The relative contributions of the rotational and divergent components to day\textendash night heat transport are likely sensitive to multiple planetary parameters and atmospheric processes and merit further study.},

The surface temperature contrast between the day and night hemispheres decreases with an increase in incident stellar flux, which is opposite the trend seen in gas giants. We define three dynamical regimes in terms of the equatorial Rossby deformation radius and the Rhines length. The slow rotation regime has a mean zonal circulation that spans from the day to the night sides, which occurs for planets around stars with effective temperatures of 3300\textendash 4500 K (rotation period days), with both the Rossby deformation radius and the Rhines length exceeding the planetary radius. Rapid rotators have a mean zonal circulation that partially spans a hemisphere and with banded cloud formation beneath the substellar point, which occurs for planets orbiting stars with effective temperatures of less than 3000 K (rotation period days), with the Rossby deformation radius less than the planetary radius. In between is the Rhines rotation regime, which retains a thermally direct circulation from the day side to the night side but also features midlatitude turbulence-driven zonal jets. Rhines rotators occur for planets around stars in the range of 3000\textendash 3300 K (rotation period {$\sim$}5\textendash 20 days), where the Rhines length is greater than the planetary radius but the Rossby deformation radius is less than the planetary radius.

Multiple linear regression is used to relate the radiation budget data to the cloud data. Comparing cloud forcing estimates obtained from the ISCCP-ERBE regression with those derived from the ERBE scene identification shows generally good agreement except over snow, in tropical convective regions, and in regions that are either nearly cloudless or always overcast. It is suggested that a substantial fraction of the disagreement in longwave cloud forcing in tropical convective regions is associated with the fact that the ERBE scene identification does not take into account variations in upper-tropospheric water vapor. On a global average basis, low clouds make the largest contribution to the net energy balance of the earth, because they cover such a large area and because their albedo effect dominates their effect on emitted thermal radiation. High, optically thick clouds can also very effectively reduce the energy balance, however, because their very high albedos overcome their low emission temperatures.},

The simulations cover the obliquity\textendash rotation parameter space, from 0\textdegree{} to 90\textdegree{} in obliquity and 1\textendash 128 days in rotation period. The simulated global mean temperatures are warmest at 45\textdegree{} obliquity with fast rotations, due to the modification of the greenhouse effect from the spatial redistribution of clouds and water vapor. The slow-moving insolation\textendash cloud mechanism, previously found in simulations with slow rotations and zero obliquity, also produces a cooling trend from intermediate obliquity to high obliquity, with the coldest climate occurring at 90\textdegree{} obliquity for all rotation periods. At low obliquities and fast rotation, persistent snow and sea ice can form, producing cooler temperatures. A Climate Habitability metric is defined, based on temperature and precipitation, which compares well with observations when applied to a simulation using Earth's obliquity and rotation. Over a wider range of obliquity and rotation period, the Climate Habitability ranges from 10\% to 70\% of the terrestrial area. Overall, the simulated global mean surface temperature shows a much larger spread across the range of simulated rotation periods at 45\textdegree{} obliquity compared to 0\textdegree{} obliquity. Therefore, we conclude that 3D exoplanet simulations using intermediate obliquities (e.g., 45\textdegree ) instead of 0\textdegree{} will reveal a wider range of possible climate conditions for specific orbital configurations. In addition, Earth's climate habitability can increase by 25\% if the obliquity increases from 23.\textdegree 5 to 45\textdegree.},

Exoplanet atmospheres can be chemically extremely rich. Exoplanet clouds are therefore composed of a mix of materials that changes throughout the atmosphere. They affect atmospheres through element depletion and through absorption and scattering; hence, they have a profound impact on an atmosphere's energy budget. While astronomical observations point us to the presence of extrasolar clouds and make first suggestions on particle size and material composition, we require fundamental and complex modeling work to merge the individual observations into a coherent picture. Part of this work includes developing an understanding of cloud formation in nonterrestrial environments. {$\blacksquare$} Exoplanet atmospheres exhibit a wide chemical diversity that enables the formation of mineral clouds in contrast to the predominant water clouds on Earth. {$\blacksquare$} Clouds consume elements, causing specific atoms and molecules to drop in abundance. Transport processes such as gravitational settling or advection delocalize this process. {$\blacksquare$} Extrasolar planets can have extreme weather conditions where day- and nightside temperatures vary hugely. This affects cloud formation, and hence the cloud coverage and atmosphere's appearance can change dramatically. {$\blacksquare$} Dynamic extrasolar clouds develop intracloud lightning, and electric circuits may occur on more local, smaller scales in giant exoplanets compared to smaller, Earth-like planets with less dramatic hydrodynamics.},

Observations begin to provide insight into the composition of their extended atmospheres and their chemical day/night asymmetries. Both are strongly affected by cloud formation. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: We explore trends in cloud properties for a sample of five giant gas planets: the hot gas giant WASP-43b and the four ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) WASP-18b, HAT-P-7b, WASP-103b, and WASP-121b. This provides a reference frame for cloud properties for the JWST targets WASP-43b and WASP-121b. We further explore chemically inert tracers to observe geometrical asymmetries of UHJs and if the location of the inner boundary of a 3D global circulation model (3D GCM) matters for the clouds that form. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: A homogeneous set of 3D GCM results was used as input for a kinetic cloud formation code to evaluate the cloud opacity and gas parameters such as C/O, mean molecular weight, and degree of ionisation. We cast our results in terms of integrated quantities to enable a global comparison between the sample planets. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: The large day/night temperature differences of UHJs cause the following chemical asymmetries: cloud-free days but cloudy nights, atomic versus molecular gases and their different mean molecular weights, deep thermal ionospheres versus low-ionised atmospheres, and undepleted versus enhanced C/O. WASP-18b, as the heaviest planet in the sample, has the lowest global C/O. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: The global climate may be considered as similar amongst UHJs, but different to that of hot gas giants. The local weather, however, is individual for each planet since the local thermodynamic conditions, and hence the local cloud and gas properties, differ. The morning and the evening terminator of UHJs will carry signatures of their strong chemical asymmetry such that ingress and egress asymmetries can be expected. An increased C/O ratio is a clear sign of cloud formation, making cloud modelling a necessity when utilising C/O (or other mineral ratios) as a tracer for planet formation. The changing geometrical extension of the atmosphere from the day to the nightside may be probed through chemically inert species such as helium. Ultra-hot Jupiters are likely to develop deep atmospheric ionospheres which may impact the atmosphere dynamics through magneto-hydrodynamic processes.},

The resulting expressions for all three Hadley cell edges are predictive except for diagnosed values of Ro and two proportionality constants. Thermal inertia\textemdash which damps and lags the ascent latitude relative to the insolation\textemdash is accounted for semianalytically through the Mitchell et al. model of an ``effective'' seasonal forcing cycle. Our theory, given empirically an additional {$\sim$}1-month lag for the descending edge, captures the climatological annual cycle of the ascending and descending edges in an Earthlike simulation in an idealized aquaplanet general circulation model (GCM). In simulations in this and two other idealized GCMs with varied planetary rotation rate ({$\Omega$}), the winter, descending edge of the solsticial, cross-equatorial Hadley cell scales approximately as {$\Omega-$}1/2 and the summer, ascending edge as {$\Omega-$}2/3, both in accordance with our theory. Possible future refinements and tests of the theory are discussed.},

The connection between Titan's surface and atmosphere is also unique in our solar system; atmospheric chemistry produces materials that are deposited on the surface and subsequently altered by surface-atmosphere interactions such as aeolian and fluvial processes resulting in the formation of extensive dune fields and expansive lakes and seas. Titan's atmosphere is favorable for organic haze formation, which combined with the presence of some oxygen-bearing molecules indicates that Titan's atmosphere may produce molecules of prebiotic interest. The combination of organics and liquid, in the form of water in a subsurface ocean and methane/ethane in the surface lakes and seas, means that Titan may be the ideal place in the solar system to test ideas about habitability, prebiotic chemistry, and the ubiquity and diversity of life in the universe. The Cassini-Huygens mission to the Saturn system has provided a wealth of new information allowing for study of Titan as a complex system. Here I review our current understanding of Titan's atmosphere and climate forged from the powerful combination of Earth-based observations, remote sensing and in situ spacecraft measurements, laboratory experiments, and models. I conclude with some of our remaining unanswered questions as the incredible era of exploration with Cassini-Huygens comes to an end.},

In this study, we use the ROCKE-3D dynamic ocean general circulation model to study the effects of slow rotations and increased insolations on the ``fractional habitability'' and silicate weathering rate of an Earth-like world. Defining the fractional habitability fh to be the percentage of a planet's surface that falls in the 0 {$\leq$} T {$\leq$} 100 \textdegree C temperature regime, we find a moderate increase in fh with a 10\% and 20\% increase in insolation and a possible maximum in fh at sidereal day lengths between 8 and 32 times that of the modern Earth. By tracking precipitation and runoff, we further determine that there is a rotational regime centered on a 4 day period in which the silicate weathering rate is maximized and is particularly strongly peaked at higher overall insolations. Because of weathering's integral role in the long-term carbonate\textendash silicate cycle, we suggest that climate stability may be strongly affected by the anticipated rotational evolution of temperate terrestrial-type worlds and should be considered a major factor in their study. In light of our results, we argue that planetary rotation period is an important factor to consider when determining the habitability of terrestrial worlds.},

  abstract = {The climate of a planet can be strongly affected by its eccentricity due to variations in the stellar flux. There are two limits for the dependence of the inner habitable zone boundary (IHZ) on eccentricity: (1) the mean stellar flux approximation (), in which the temperature is approximately constant throughout the orbit, and (2) the maximum stellar flux approximation (S IHZ {$\propto$} (1 - e)2), in which the temperature adjusts instantaneously to the stellar flux. Which limit is appropriate is determined by the dimensionless parameter , where C is the heat capacity of the planet, P is the orbital period, and , where {$\Omega$} is the outgoing long-wave radiation and T s is the surface temperature. We use the Buckingham {$\Pi$} theorem to derive an analytical function for the IHZ in terms of eccentricity and {$\Pi$}. We then build a time-dependent energy balance model to resolve the surface temperature evolution and constrain our analytical result. We find that {$\Pi$} must be greater than about {$\sim$}1 for the mean stellar flux approximation to be nearly exact and less than about {$\sim$}0.01 for the maximum stellar flux approximation to be nearly exact. In addition to assuming a constant heat capacity, we also consider the effective heat capacity including latent heat (evaporation and precipitation). We find that for planets with an Earthlike ocean, the IHZ should follow the mean stellar flux limit for all eccentricities. This work will aid in the prioritization of potentially habitable exoplanets with nonzero eccentricity for follow-up characterization.},

We present results of three-dimensional simulations of the atmospheres of such planets, and comment on their possible habitability. Near the ground, a thermally direct longitudinal cell exists, transporting heat from the dayside to the nightside. The circulation is three-dimensional, with low-level winds returning mass to the dayside across the polar regions. Aloft, the zonally averaged winds display a pattern of strong superrotation due to these planets' finite (albeit small) rotation rate. With terrestrial values of insolation, a CO2/H2O atmosphere collapses, or condenses on the surface of the darkside, when surface pressure is approximately 30 mb, this value being much lower for a N2atmosphere. This temperature contrast is also sensitive to factors such as gravity, planetary radius, and IR optical depth {$\tau$}. These results question the suitability of the concept of a habitable zone around M dwarfs that is independent of planetary parameters. If CO2partial pressure is controlled by the carbonate\textendash silicate cycle, we find that these planets should have a minimum surface pressure of 1000\textendash 1500 mb of CO2, as this is the minimum pressure needed to support stable liquid water on the darkside at the inner edge of the habitable zone. We finally conclude that planets orbiting M stars can support atmospheres over a large range of conditions and, despite constraints such as stellar activity, are very likely to be habitable.},

  abstract = {Abstract The processes regulating the climatology and annual cycle of the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) and cold point are not fully understood. Three main drivers have been identified: planetary-scale equatorial waves excited by tropical convection, planetary-scale extratropical waves associated with the deep Brewer\textendash Dobson circulation, and synoptic-scale waves associated with the midlatitude storm tracks. In both observations and comprehensive atmospheric models, all three coexist, making it difficult to separate their contributions. Here, a new intermediate-complexity atmospheric model is developed. Simple modification of the model's lower boundary allows detailed study of the three processes key to the TTL, both in isolation and together. The model shows that tropical planetary waves are most critical for regulating the mean TTL, setting the depth and temperature of the cold point. The annual cycle of the TTL, which is coldest (warmest) in boreal winter (summer), however, depends critically on the strong annual variation in baroclinicity of the Northern Hemisphere relative to that of the Southern Hemisphere. Planetary-scale waves excited from either the tropics or extratropics then double the impact of baroclinicity on the TTL annual cycle. The remarkably generic response of TTL temperatures over a range of configurations suggests that the details of the wave forcing are unimportant, provided there is sufficient variation in the upward extent of westerly winds over the annual cycle. Westerly winds enable the propagation of stationary Rossby waves, and weakening of the subtropical jet in boreal summer inhibits their propagation into the lower stratosphere, warming the TTL.},

We try to understand the mechanisms through a series of feedback suppression experiments. When the ice-albedo feedback is turned off, the temperature contrast between high and low obliquity remains significant, but it vanishes when the cloud radiation effects or the seasonal variation is turned off. This suggests that a warmer climate on high-obliquity planets does not rely completely on the existence of ice, and therefore holds at high insolation. In that regime, the surface temperature, and hence the cloud formation, lags behind the substellar point, leading to inefficient sunlight reflection and a warmer climate.},

In the zonal mean, the transports by transient eddies dominate over those by stationary eddies, but this is not necessarily the case locally. In particular, in storm-track entrance and exit regions during winter, stationary eddies and their interactions with the mean flow dominate the atmospheric energy transport. Here it is shown that stationary eddies can shape storm tracks and control where they terminate by modifying local baroclinicity. Simulations with an idealized aquaplanet GCM show that zonally localized surface heating alone (e.g., ocean heat flux convergence) gives rise to storm tracks, which have a well-defined length scale that is similar to that of Earth's storm tracks. The storm tracks terminate downstream of the surface heating even in the absence of continents, at a distance controlled by the stationary Rossby wavelength scale. Stationary eddies play a dual role: within about half a Rossby wavelength downstream of the heating region, stationary eddy energy fluxes increase the baroclinicity and therefore contribute to energizing the storm track; farther downstream, enhanced poleward and upward energy transport by stationary eddies reduces the baroclinicity by reducing the meridional temperature gradients and enhancing the static stability. Transports both of sensible and latent heat (water vapor) play important roles in determining where storm tracks terminate.},

Characterization of the atmospheres of warm super-Earths has already begun and will be extended to smaller and more distant planets over the coming decade. The habitability of these worlds may be strongly affected by their three-dimensional atmospheric circulation regimes, since the global climate feedbacks that control the inner and outer edges of the habitable zone\textemdash including transitions to Snowball-like states and runaway-greenhouse feedbacks\textemdash depend on the equator-to-pole temperature differences, patterns of relative humidity, and other aspects of the dynamics. Here, using an idealized moist atmospheric general circulation model including a hydrological cycle, we study the dynamical principles governing the atmospheric dynamics on such planets. We show how the planetary rotation rate, stellar flux, atmospheric mass, surface gravity, optical thickness, and planetary radius affect the atmospheric circulation and temperature distribution on such planets. Our simulations demonstrate that equator-to-pole temperature differences, meridional heat transport rates, structure and strength of the winds, and the hydrological cycle vary strongly with these parameters, implying that the sensitivity of the planet to global climate feedbacks will depend significantly on the atmospheric circulation. We elucidate the possible climatic regimes and diagnose the mechanisms controlling the formation of atmospheric jet streams, Hadley and Ferrel cells, and latitudinal temperature differences. Finally, we discuss the implications for understanding how the atmospheric circulation influences the global climate.},

In exoplanetary systems, exoterrestrial planets should have various obliquities. High-obliquity planets would have extreme seasonal cycles due to the seasonal change of the distribution of the insolation. Here, we introduce the Non-hydrostatic ICosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM), a global cloud-resolving model, to investigate the climate of high-obliquity planets. This model can explicitly simulate a three-dimensional cloud distribution and vertical transports of water vapor. We simulated exoterrestrial climates with high resolution using the supercomputer FUGAKU. We assumed aqua-planet configurations with 1 bar of air as a background atmosphere, with four different obliquities (0\textdegree, 23.5\textdegree, 45\textdegree, and 60\textdegree ). We ran two sets of simulations: (1) low resolution ({$\sim$}220 km mesh as the standard resolution of a general circulation model for exoplanetary science) with parameterization for cloud formation, and (2) high resolution ({$\sim$}14 km mesh) with an explicit cloud microphysics scheme. Results suggest that high-resolution simulations with an explicit treatment of cloud microphysics reveal warmer climates due to less low cloud fraction and a large amount of water vapor in the atmosphere. It implies that treatments of cloud-related processes lead to a difference between different resolutions in climatic regimes in cases with high obliquities.},

Linearity implies that radiative forcing has the same impact in warmer as in colder climates and is thus of fundamental importance for understanding past and future climate change. Although the evidence for a nearly linear relation was first pointed out more than 50 y ago, it is still unclear why this relation is valid and when it breaks down. Here we present a simple semianalytical model that explains Earth's linear OLR as an emergent property of an atmosphere whose greenhouse effect is dominated by a condensable gas. Linearity arises from a competition between the surface's increasing thermal emission and the narrowing of spectral window regions with warming and breaks down at high temperatures once continuum absorption cuts off spectral windows. Our model provides a way of understanding the longwave contribution to Earth's climate sensitivity and suggests that extrasolar planets with other condensable greenhouse gases could have climate dynamics similar to Earth's.},

  abstract = {The recent detections of temperate terrestrial planets orbiting nearby stars and the promise of characterizing their atmospheres motivate a need to understand how the diversity of possible planetary parameters affects the climate of terrestrial planets. In this work, we investigate the atmospheric circulation and climate of terrestrial exoplanets orbiting both Sun-like and M dwarf stars over a wide swath of possible planetary parameters, including the planetary rotation period, surface pressure, incident stellar flux, surface gravity, planetary radius, and cloud particle size. We do so using a general circulation model (GCM) that includes nongray radiative transfer and the effects of clouds. The results from this suite of simulations generally show qualitatively similar dependencies of circulation and climate on planetary parameters to idealized GCMs, with quantitative differences due to the inclusion of additional model physics. Notably, we find that the effective cloud particle size is a key unknown parameter that can greatly affect the climate of terrestrial exoplanets. We confirm a transition between low and high dayside cloud coverage of synchronously rotating terrestrial planets with increasing rotation period. We determine that this cloud transition is due to eddy-driven convergence near the substellar point and should not be parameterization dependent. Finally, we compute full-phase light curves from our simulations of planets orbiting M dwarf stars, finding that changing incident stellar flux and rotation period affect observable properties of terrestrial exoplanets. Our GCM results can guide expectations for planetary climate over the broad range of possible terrestrial exoplanets that will be observed with future space telescopes.},

  abstract = {Abstract A theoretical framework is developed to estimate the supersaturation in liquid, ice, and mixed-phase clouds. An equation describing supersaturation in mixed-phase clouds in general form is considered here. The solution for this equation is obtained for the case of quasi-steady approximation, that is, when particle sizes stay constant. It is shown that the supersaturation asymptotically approaches the quasi-steady supersaturation over time. This creates a basis for the estimation of the supersaturation in clouds from the quasi-steady supersaturation calculations. The quasi-steady supersaturation is a function of the vertical velocity and size distributions of liquid and ice particles, which can be obtained from in situ measurements. It is shown that, in mixed-phase clouds, the evaporating droplets maintain the water vapor pressure close to saturation over water, which enables the analytical estimation of the time of glaciation of mixed-phase clouds. The limitations of the quasi-steady approximation in clouds with different phase composition are considered here. The role of phase relaxation time, as well as the effect of the characteristic time and spatial scales of turbulent fluctuations, are also discussed.},

Altitude profiles of 27 components agree well with those measured in the upper and middle atmosphere. H2O and SO2 mixing ratios are very similar and sharply decrease at 60 km due to SO2 photolysis and sulphuric acid formation.

  abstract = {The inner edge of the classical habitable zone is often defined by the critical flux needed to trigger the runaway greenhouse instability. This 1D notion of a critical flux, however, may not be all that relevant for inhomogeneously irradiated planets, or when the water content is limited (land planets). Based on results from our 3D global climate model, we present general features of the climate and large-scale circulation on close-in terrestrial planets. We find that the circulation pattern can shift from super-rotation to stellar/anti stellar circulation when the equatorial Rossby deformation radius significantly exceeds the planetary radius, changing the redistribution properties of the atmosphere. Using analytical and numerical arguments, we also demonstrate the presence of systematic biases among mean surface temperatures and among temperature profiles predicted from either 1D or 3D simulations. After including a complete modeling of the water cycle, we further demonstrate that two stable climate regimes can exist for land planets closer than the inner edge of the classical habitable zone. One is the classical runaway state where all the water is vaporized, and the other is a collapsed state where water is captured in permanent cold traps. We identify this ``moist'' bistability as the result of a competition between the greenhouse effect of water vapor and its condensation on the night side or near the poles, highlighting the dynamical nature of the runaway greenhouse effect. We also present synthetic spectra showing the observable signature of these two states. Taking the example of two prototype planets in this regime, namely Gl 581 c and HD 85512 b, we argue that depending on the rate of water delivery and atmospheric escape during the life of these planets, they could accumulate a significant amount of water ice at their surface. If such a thick ice cap is present, various physical mechanisms observed on Earth (e.g., gravity driven ice flows, geothermal flux) should come into play to produce long-lived liquid water at the edge and/or bottom of the ice cap. Consequently, the habitability of planets at smaller orbital distance than the inner edge of the classical habitable zone cannot be ruled out. Transiting planets in this regime represent promising targets for upcoming exoplanet characterization observatories, such as EChO and JWST.},

In the first part of the paper we examine the consequences of different values of obliquity and eccentricity for the spatio-temporal patterns of radiation and surface temperatures as well as for the main characteristics of the atmospheric circulation. In the second part of the paper we analyse the associated implications for the habitability of planets close to the outer edge of the habitable zone (HZ). The second part focuses in particular on the multistability property of climate, i.e. the parallel existence of both an ice-free and an ice-covered climate state. Our results show that seasonal variability affects both the existence of and transitions between the two climate states. Moreover, our experiments reveal that planets with Earth-like atmospheres and high seasonal variability can have ice-free areas at much larger distance from the host star than planets without seasonal variability, which leads to a substantial expansion of the outer edge of the HZ. Sensitivity experiments exploring the role of azimuthal obliquity and surface heat capacity test the robustness of our results. On circular orbits, our findings obtained with a general circulation model agree well with previous studies based on one dimensional energy balance models, whereas significant differences are found on eccentric orbits.},

  abstract = {A simple diagnostic cloud scheme (SimCloud) for general circulation models (GCMs), which has a modest level of complexity and is transparent in describing its dependence on tunable parameters, is proposed in this study. The large-scale clouds, which form the core of the scheme, are diagnosed from relative humidity. In addition, the marine low stratus clouds, typically found off the west coast of continents over subtropical oceans, are determined largely as a function of inversion strength. A ``freeze-dry'' adjustment based on a simple function of specific humidity is also available to reduce an excessive cloud bias in polar regions. Other cloud properties, such as the effective radius of cloud droplet and cloud liquid water content, are specified as simple functions of temperature. All of these features are user-configurable. The cloud scheme is implemented in Isca, a modeling framework designed to enable the construction of GCMs at varying levels of complexity, but could readily be adapted to other GCMs. Simulations using the scheme with realistic continents generally capture the observed structure of cloud fraction and cloud radiative effect (CRE), as well as its seasonal variation. Specifically, the explicit low-cloud scheme improves the simulation of shortwave CREs over the eastern subtropical oceans by increasing the cloud fraction and cloud water path. The freeze-dry adjustment alleviates the longwave CRE biases in polar regions, especially in winter. However, the longwave CRE in tropical regions and shortwave CRE over the extratropics are both still too strong compared to observations. Nevertheless, this simple cloud scheme provides a suitable basis for examining the impacts of clouds on climate in idealized modeling frameworks.},

  abstract = {Ongoing discoveries of terrestrial exoplanets and the desire to determine their habitability have created an increasing demand for studies of a wide range of climatic regimes and atmospheric circulations. These studies have, in turn, challenged our understanding of our own planet's atmospheric dynamics and provided new frameworks with which we can further our understanding of planetary atmospheres. In this work, we use an idealized moist general circulation model in aquaplanet configuration to study the atmospheric circulation of terrestrial planets with high obliquities. With seasonally varying insolation forcing and a shallow slab ocean as a lower boundary, we emphasize seasonal phenomena that might not be captured in simulations with annual mean forcing and that might involve nonlinear behaviors. By progressively increasing obliquity, we explore the response of the large-scale atmospheric circulation to more extreme seasonal cycles and a reversed annual mean equator-to-pole insolation distribution, and its impact on the energy and water cycles. We show that for high obliquities, the large-scale atmospheric circulation and the meridional energy transport are dominated by seasonally reversing broad cross-equatorial Hadley cells that transport energy from the summer to the winter hemisphere and significantly mitigate temperature extremes. These overturning cells also play a major role in shaping the planet's hydrological cycle, with the associated ascending branches and precipitation convergence zones becoming progressively broader and more poleward shifted into the summer hemisphere with higher obliquities. While not embedded within the Hadley cell ascending branches, the hot summer poles of high obliquity planets experience nonnegligible precipitation during and at the end of the warm season: during the summer, lower-level moist static energy maxima at the summer poles force locally enhanced convective activity. As temperatures rapidly drop at the end of the summer and convective activity decreases, the water-holding capacity of the atmosphere decreases and water vapor stored in the atmospheric column rapidly condenses out, extending the duration of the summer pole rainy season into the corresponding autumn. Our study reveals novel understanding of how atmospheric dynamics might influence a planet's overall climate and its variability.},

We primarily focus on the extratropical circulation and the counterintuitive weakening of extratropical eddy activity, and associated precipitating storm tracks, with increased obliquity. We show that on high-obliquity planets with a small surface thermal inertia, net energy deficit during the winter months is primarily balanced by the latent energy component of the atmospheric heat capacity, which buffers any significant atmospheric cooling. As temperatures finally start to decrease, condensational latent heat release of atmospheric moisture further slows down the cooling and keeps the winter pole warmer than the midlatitudes until after the winter solstice. This prevents vigorous baroclinic eddy activity, which lives off the potential energy stored in the sloping isopycnals, as well as the development of a Ferrel cell and storm track. For planets with larger surface heat capacity, we see a similar suppression, with the energy storage in the ocean surface, rather than atmospheric latent energy storage, primarily balancing the net energy loss during the winter months. These results suggest that, regardless of surface thermal inertia, water-covered high-obliquity Earth-like planets would not experience significant extratropical storm activity and highlight the need for a proper characterization of polar properties in planetary modeling and observational investigations.},

The latter is shown to depend on the dynamical core's ability to build up angular momentum from surface torques. Simulated latitudinal temperature contrasts are adequate, compared to observations, and polar temperature anomalies agree with observations. In the lower atmosphere, the insolation distribution is shown to strongly impact turbulent fluxes, and surface heating is maximum at mid-latitudes. Surface liquids are unstable at mid- and low-latitudes, and quickly migrate poleward. The simulated humidity profile and distribution of surface temperatures, compared to observations, corroborate the prevalence of dry conditions at low latitudes.

Such models have been employed over the last decade to investigate various aspects of Titan's atmosphere and climate, and several three-dimensional general circulation models (GCMs) now exist that simulate Titan with a high degree of fidelity. However, substantial uncertainties persist, and at the same time no dedicated intercomparisons have assessed the degree to which these models agree with each other or the observations. To address this gap, and motivated by the proposed Dragonfly Titan lander mission, we directly compare three Titan GCMs to each other and to in situ observations, and also provide multi-model expectations for the low-latitude environment during the early northern winter season. Globally, the models qualitatively agree in their representation of the atmospheric structure and circulation, though one model severely underestimates meridional temperature gradients and zonal winds. We find that, at low latitudes, simulated and observed atmospheric temperatures closely agree in all cases, while the measured winds above the boundary layer are only quantitatively matched by one model. Nevertheless, the models simulate similar near-surface winds, and all indicate these are weak. Likewise, temperatures and methane content at low latitudes are similar between models, with some differences that are largely attributable to modeling assumptions. All models predict environments that closely resemble that encountered by the Huygens probe, including little or no precipitation at low latitudes during northern winter. The most significant differences concern the methane cycle, though the models are least comparable in this area and substantial uncertainties remain. We suggest that, while the overall low-latitude environment on Titan at this season is now fairly well constrained, future in situ measurements and monitoring will transform our understanding of regional and temporal variability, atmosphere-surface coupling, Titan's methane cycle, and modeling thereof.},

  abstract = {The cause of the hemispheric asymmetry of Titan's methane lakes and seas is the subject of ongoing debate. A leading hypothesis posits that seasonal insolation asymmetries caused by Saturn's eccentric orbit lead to differences in net precipitation over the two poles, perhaps mediated by asymmetric atmospheric transport of moisture. But topographic variations have also been proposed to contribute, albeit without considering the importance of surface hydrology. Here we present general circulation model simulations including a synchronously coupled surface and ground hydrology scheme, testing the separate and combined influences of topography and orbital forcing on Titan's hydroclimate. We find that, while topography leads to warmer polar regions relative to a flat surface which in turn enhance methane loss to the atmosphere, the overall effect on the global distribution of surface methane liquid is minor. In particular, topography does not force any notable asymmetry in the meridional circulation, nor does it affect the seasonality of the methane cycle, though it does increase the regional heterogeneity of average precipitation at mid-latitudes. We also find that Titan's atmospheric methane transport robustly responds to orbital forcing, in agreement with previous results, but this is insufficient to overcome the distribution of surface liquids dictated by surface hydrology. We conclude that Croll-Milankovitch cycles are plausible on Titan, but potentially not the dominant driver of the current distribution of liquids; relatedly, our results suggest that the volume of the large seas and lakes has not varied substantially on millennial timescales.},

  abstract = {Rotational mapping and specular reflection (glint) are two proposed methods to directly detect liquid water on the surface of habitable exoplanets. However, false positives for both methods may prevent the unambiguous detection of exoplanet oceans. We use simulations of Earth as an exoplanet to introduce a combination of multiwavelength, multiphase, time-series direct-imaging observations and accompanying analyses that may improve the robustness of exoplanet ocean detection by spatially mapping the ocean glint signal. As the planet rotates, the glint spot appears to ``blink'' as Lambertian scattering continents interrupt the specular reflection from the ocean. This manifests itself as a strong source of periodic variability in crescent-phase disk-integrated reflected light curves. We invert these light curves to constrain the longitudinal slice maps and apparent albedo of multiple surfaces at both quadrature and crescent phase. At crescent phase, the retrieved apparent albedo of ocean-bearing longitudinal slices is increased by a factor of 5, compared to the albedo at quadrature phase, due to the contribution from glint. The land-bearing slices exhibit no significant change in apparent albedo with phase. The presence of forward-scattering clouds in our simulated observation increases the overall reflectivity toward crescent, but we find that clouds do not correlate with any specific surfaces, thereby allowing for the phase-dependent glint effect to be interpreted as distinct from cloud scattering. Retrieving the same longitudinal map at quadrature and crescent phases may be used to tie changes in the apparent albedo with phase back to specific geographic surfaces (or longstanding atmospheric features), although this requires ideal geometries. We estimate that crescent-phase time-dependent glint measurements are feasible for between 1 and 10 habitable zone exoplanets orbiting the nearest G, K, and M dwarfs using a space-based, high-contrast, direct-imaging telescope with a diameter between 6 and 15 m.},

  abstract = {We present simulations of atmospheres of Earth-like aquaplanets that are tidally locked to their star, that is, planets whose orbital period is equal to the rotation period about their spin axis, so that one side always faces the star and the other side is always dark. Such simulations are of interest in the study of tidally locked terrestrial exoplanets and as illustrations of how planetary rotation and the insolation distribution shape climate. As extreme cases illustrating the effects of slow and rapid rotation, we consider planets with rotation periods equal to one current Earth year and one current Earth day. The dynamics responsible for the surface climate (e.g., winds, temperature, precipitation) and the general circulation of the atmosphere are discussed in light of existing theories of atmospheric circulations. For example, as expected from the increasing importance of Coriolis accelerations relative to inertial accelerations as the rotation rate increases, the winds are approximately isotropic and divergent at leading order in the slowly rotating atmosphere but are predominantly zonal and rotational in the rapidly rotating atmosphere. Free-atmospheric horizontal temperature variations in the slowly rotating atmosphere are generally weaker than in the rapidly rotating atmosphere. Interestingly, the surface temperature on the night side of the planets does not fall below {$\sim$}240 K in either the rapidly or slowly rotating atmosphere; that is, heat transport from the day side to the night side of the planets efficiently reduces temperature contrasts in either case. Rotational waves and eddies shape the distribution of winds, temperature, and precipitation in the rapidly rotating atmosphere; in the slowly rotating atmosphere, these distributions are controlled by simpler divergent circulations. Both the slowly and rapidly rotating atmospheres exhibit equatorial superrotation. Systematic variation of the planetary rotation rate shows that the equatorial superrotation varies non-monotonically with rotation rate, whereas the surface temperature contrast between the day side and the night side does not vary strongly with changes in rotation rate.},

The recent discovery of midlatitude tropospheric clouds on Titan has caused much excitement about the roles of surface sources of methane and the global circulation in forming clouds. Although localized surface sources, such as methane geysers or ``cryovolcanoes,'' have been invoked to explain these clouds, we find in this work that clouds appear in regions of convergence by the mean meridional circulation and over the poles during solstices, where the solar forcing reaches its seasonal maximum. Other regions are inhibited from forming clouds because of dynamical transports of methane and strong subsidence. We find that for a variety of moist regimes, i.e., with the effect of methane thermodynamics included, the observed cloud features can be explained by the large-scale dynamics of the atmosphere. Clouds at the solsticial pole are found to be a robust feature of Titan's dynamics, whereas isolated midlatitude clouds are present exclusively in a variety of moist dynamical regimes. In all cases, even without including methane thermodynamics, our model ceases to produce polar clouds {$\approx$}4\textendash 6 terrestrial years after solstices.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of dry atmospheric general circulation model simulations forced by seasonally varying Newtonian relaxation are explored over a wide range of two control parameters and are compared with the large-scale circulation of Earth, Mars, and Titan in their relevant parameter regimes. Of the parameters that govern the behavior of the system, the thermal Rossby number (Ro) has previously been found to be important in governing the spontaneous transition from an Earth-like climatology of winds to a superrotating one with prograde equatorial winds, in the absence of a seasonal cycle. This case is somewhat unrealistic as it applies only if the planet has zero obliquity or if surface thermal inertia is very large. While Venus has nearly vanishing obliquity, Earth, Mars, and Titan (Saturn) all have obliquities of ∼25° and varying degrees of seasonality due to their differing thermal inertias and orbital periods. Motivated by this, we introduce a time-dependent Newtonian cooling to drive a seasonal cycle using idealized model forcing, and we define a second control parameter that mimics non-dimensional thermal inertia of planetary surfaces. We then perform and analyze simulations across the parameter range bracketed by Earth-like and Titan-like regimes, assess the impact on the spontaneous transition to superrotation, and compare Earth, Mars, and Titan to the model simulations in the relevant parameter regime. We find that a large seasonal cycle (small thermal inertia) prevents model atmospheres with large thermal Rossby numbers from developing superrotation by the influences of (1) cross-equatorial momentum advection by the Hadley circulation and (2) hemispherically asymmetric zonal-mean zonal winds that suppress instabilities leading to equatorial momentum convergence. We also demonstrate that baroclinic instabilities must be sufficiently weak to allow superrotation to develop. In the relevant parameter regimes, our seasonal model simulations compare favorably to large-scale, seasonal phenomena observed on Earth and Mars. In the Titan-like regime the seasonal cycle in our model acts to prevent superrotation from developing, and it is necessary to increase the value of a third parameter—the atmospheric Newtonian cooling time—to achieve a superrotating climatology.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, the Cassini-Huygens mission to the Saturn system has revolutionized our understanding of Titan and its climate. Veiled in a thick organic haze, Titan's visible appearance belies an active, seasonal weather cycle operating in the lower atmosphere. Here we review the climate of Titan, as gleaned from observations and models. Titan's cold surface temperatures ({$\sim$}90 K) allow methane to form clouds and precipitation analogously to Earth's hydrologic cycle. Because of Titan's slow rotation and small size, its atmospheric circulation falls into a regime resembling Earth's tropics, with weak horizontal temperature gradients. A general overview of how Titan's atmosphere responds to seasonal forcing is provided by estimating a number of climate-related timescales. Titan lacks a global ocean, but methane is cold-trapped at the poles in large seas, and models indicate that weak baroclinic storms form at the boundary of Titan's wet and dry regions. Titan's saturated troposphere is a substantial reservoir of methane, supplied by deep convection from the summer poles. A significant seasonal cycle, first revealed by observations of clouds, causes Titan's convergence zone to migrate deep into the summer hemispheres, but its connection to polar convection remains undetermined. Models suggest that downwelling of air at the winter pole communicates upper-level radiative cooling, reducing the stability of the middle troposphere and priming the atmosphere for spring and summer storms when sunlight returns to Titan's lakes. Despite great gains in our understanding of Titan, many challenges remain. The greatest mystery is how Titan is able to retain an abundance of atmospheric methane with only limited surface liquids, while methane is being irreversibly destroyed by photochemistry. A related mystery is how Titan is able to hide all the ethane that is produced in this process. Future studies will need to consider the interactions between Titan's atmosphere, surface, and subsurface in order to make further progress in understanding Titan's complex climate system.},

  abstract = {In order to investigate a possible variety of atmospheric states realized on a synchronously rotating aquaplanet, an experiment studying the impact of planetary rotation rate is performed using an atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) with simplified hydrological and radiative processes. The entire planetary surface is covered with a swamp ocean. The value of planetary rotation rate is varied from zero to the Earth's, while other parameters such as planetary radius, mean molecular weight and total mass of atmospheric dry components, and solar constant are set to the present Earth's values. The integration results show that the atmosphere reaches statistically equilibrium states for all runs; none of the calculated cases exemplifies the runaway greenhouse state. The circulation patterns obtained are classified into four types: Type-I characterized by the dominance of a day-night thermally direct circulation, Type-II characterized by a zonal wave number one resonant Rossby wave over a meridionally broad westerly jet on the equator, Type-III characterized by a long time scale north-south asymmetric variation, and Type-IV characterized by a pair of mid-latitude westerly jets. With the increase of planetary rotation rate, the circulation evolves from Type-I to Type-II and then to Type-III gradually and smoothly, whereas the change from Type-III to Type-IV is abrupt and discontinuous. Over a finite range of planetary rotation rate, both Types-III and -IV emerge as statistically steady states, constituting multiple equilibria. In spite of the substantial changes in circulation, the net energy transport from the day side to the night side remains almost insensitive to planetary rotation rate, although the partition into dry static energy and latent heat energy transports changes. The reason for this notable insensitivity is that the outgoing longwave radiation over the broad area of the day side is constrained by the radiation limit of a moist atmosphere, so that the transport to the night side, which is determined as the difference between the incoming solar radiation and the radiation limit, cannot change greatly.},

  abstract = {Abstract A wide range of hydrological cycles and general circulations was simulated with an idealized general circulation model (GCM) by varying the optical thickness of the longwave absorber. While the idealized GCM does not capture the full complexity of the hydrological cycle, the wide range of climates simulated allows the systematic development and testing of theories of how precipitation and moisture transport change as the climate changes. The simulations show that the character of the response of the hydrological cycle to variations in longwave optical thickness differs in different climate regimes. The global-mean precipitation increases linearly with surface temperature for colder climates, but it asymptotically approaches a maximum at higher surface temperatures. The basic features of the precipitation\textendash temperature relation, including the rate of increase in the linear regime, are reproduced in radiative\textendash convective equilibrium simulations. Energy constraints partially account for the precipitation\textendash temperature relation but are not quantitatively accurate. Large-scale condensation is most important in the midlatitude storm tracks, and its behavior is accounted for using a stochastic model of moisture advection and condensation. The precipitation associated with large-scale condensation does not scale with mean specific humidity, partly because the condensation region moves upward and meridionally as the climate warms, and partly because the mean condensation rate depends on isentropic specific humidity gradients, which do not scale with the specific humidity itself. The local water vapor budget relates local precipitation to evaporation and meridional moisture fluxes, whose scaling in the subtropics and extratropics is examined. A delicate balance between opposing changes in evaporation and moisture flux divergence holds in the subtropical dry zones. The extratropical precipitation maximum follows the storm track in warm climates but lies equatorward of the storm track in cold climates.},

	abstract = {Abstract The question “What determines the meridional heat transport (MHT)?” is explored by performing a series of rotation-rate experiments with an aquaplanet GCM coupled to a slab ocean. The change of meridional heat transport with rotation rate falls into two regimes: in a “slow rotating” regime (rotation rate {\textless} 1/2 modern rotation) MHT decreases with increasing rotation rate, whereas in a “fast rotating” regime (rotation rate ≥ 1/2 modern rotation) MHT is nearly invariant. The two-regime feature of MHT is primarily related to the reduction in tropical clouds and increase in tropical temperature that are associated with the narrowing and weakening of the Hadley cell with increasing rotation rate. In the slow-rotating regime, the Hadley cell contracts and weakens as rotation rate is increased; the resulting warming causes a local increase in outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), which consequently decreases MHT. In the fast-rotating regime, the Hadley cell continues to contract as rotation rate is increased, resulting in a decrease in tropical and subtropical clouds that increases the local absorbed shortwave radiation (ASR) by an amount that almost exactly compensates the local increases in OLR. In the fast-rotating regime, the model heat transport is approximately diffusive, with an effective eddy diffusivity that is consistent with eddy mixing-length theory. The effective eddy diffusivity decreases with increasing rotation rate. However, this decrease is nearly offset by a strong increase in the meridional gradient of moist static energy and hence results in a near-constancy of MHT. The results herein extend previous work on the MHT by highlighting that the spatial patterns of clouds and the factors that influence them are leading controls on MHT.},

To date, there has not been a systematic study on climate patterns on these planets that will significantly influence their observations. Here we investigate the atmospheric dynamics of nonsynchronized, fast-rotating exoplanets across various radiative timescales, eccentricities, and obliquities using a shallow water model. The dynamical pattern can be demarcated into five regimes in terms of radiative timescale τrad and obliquity θ. An atmosphere with τrad shorter than a planetary day usually exhibits a strong day–night temperature contrast and a day-to-night flow pattern. In the intermediate τrad regime between a planetary day and a year, the atmosphere is dominated by steady temperature and eastward jet patterns for θ ≤ 18° but shows a strong seasonal variation for θ ≥ 18° because the polar region undergoes an intense heating at around the summer solstice. If τrad is larger than a year, seasonal variation is very weak. In this regime, eastward jets are developed for θ ≤ 54° and westward jets are developed for θ ≥ 54°. These dynamical regimes are also applicable to planets in eccentric orbits. The large effects of exoplanetary obliquities on circulation patterns might offer observational signatures, which will be investigated in Paper II of this study.},

This is done using two parameters that are conserved with adiabatic altitude changes and that mix in a nearly linear manner. The method employed is only applicable to cloud regions that do not contain significant amounts of ice or precipitation size drops. The analysis shows that most of the entrained air originates several kilometers above the observation level. The mixed regions are typically found in downdrafts and the weaker updraft regions. The present results are inconsistent with the laterally entraining plume model. The results indicate that mixing of dry environmental air with cloud air produces sufficient evaporative cooling to create downdrafts that penetrate several kilometers into the cloud. The updraft air is diluted primarily through mixing with nearby downdraft air.},

  abstract = {Over a large range of equilibrium temperatures, clouds shape the transmission spectrum of hot Jupiter atmospheres, yet their composition remains unknown. Recent observations show that the Kepler light curves of some hot Jupiters are asymmetric: for the hottest planets, the light curve peaks before secondary eclipse, whereas for planets cooler than {$\sim$}1900 K, it peaks after secondary eclipse. We use the thermal structure from 3D global circulation models to determine the expected cloud distribution and Kepler light curves of hot Jupiters. We demonstrate that the change from an optical light curve dominated by thermal emission to one dominated by scattering (reflection) naturally explains the observed trend from negative to positive offset. For the cool planets the presence of an asymmetry in the Kepler light curve is a telltale sign of the cloud composition, because each cloud species can produce an offset only over a narrow range of effective temperatures. By comparing our models and the observations, we show that the cloud composition of hot Jupiters likely varies with equilibrium temperature. We suggest that a transition occurs between silicate and manganese sulfide clouds at a temperature near 1600 K, analogous to the L/T transition on brown dwarfs. The cold trapping of cloud species below the photosphere naturally produces such a transition and predicts similar transitions for other condensates, including TiO. We predict that most hot Jupiters should have cloudy nightsides, that partial cloudiness should be common at the limb, and that the dayside hot spot should often be cloud-free.},

The circulations are discussed in terms of fluid dynamical concepts arising from study of the Earth's tropics, supplemented by general circulation model simulations. Even in the relatively simple context of dry (noncondensing) dynamics, there are a number of important unresolved issues that require further study.},

  abstract = {Abstract A parameterization is introduced for the prediction of cloud water in the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate Model version 3 (CCM3). The new parameterization makes a much closer connection between the meteorological processes that determine condensate formation and the condensate amount. The parameterization removes some constraints from the simulation by allowing a substantially wider range of variation in condensate amount than in the standard CCM3 and tying the condensate amount to local physical processes. The parameterization also allows cloud drops to form prior to the onset of grid-box saturation and can require a significant length of time to convert condensate to a precipitable form, or to remove the condensate. The free parameters of the scheme were adjusted to provide reasonable agreement with top of atmosphere and surface fluxes of energy. The parameterization was evaluated by a comparison with satellite and in situ measures of liquid and ice cloud amounts. The effect of the parameterization on the model simulation was then examined by comparing long model simulations to a similar run with the standard CCM and through comparison with climatologies based upon meteorological observations. Global ice and liquid water burdens are higher in the revised model than in the control simulation, with an accompanying increase in height of the center of mass of cloud water. Zonal averages of cloud water contents were 20\%\textendash 50\% lower near the surface and much higher above. The range of variation of cloud water contents is much broader in the new parameterization but was still not as large as measurements suggest. Differences in the simulation were generally small. The largest significant changes found to the simulation were seen in polar regions (winter in the Arctic and all seasons in the Antarctic). The new parameterization significantly changes the Northern Hemisphere winter distribution of cloud water and improves the simulation of temperature and cloud amount there. Small changes were introduced in the cloud fraction to improve consistency of the meteorological parameterizations and to attempt to alleviate problems in the model (in particular, in the marine stratocumulus regime). The small changes did not make any appreciable improvement to the model simulation. The new parameterization adds significantly to the flexibility in the model and the scope of problems that can be addressed. Such a scheme is needed for a reasonable treatment of scavenging of atmospheric trace constituents, and cloud aqueous or surface chemistry. The addition of a more realistic condensate parameterization provides opportunities for a closer connection between radiative properties of the clouds, and their formation and dissipation. These processes must be treated for many problems of interest today (e.g., anthropogenic aerosol\textendash climate interactions).},

            The relationship between outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and the surface temperature has a major influence on Earth's climate sensitivity. Studies often assume that this relationship is approximately linear, but it is unclear whether the approximation always holds. Here we show that, on seasonal timescales, clear‐sky OLR is a multivalued function of local surface temperature. In many places, the OLR‐temperature relationship is better approximated by a loop than a line and we quantify the resulting “OLR loopiness”, that is, how much clear‐sky OLR varies between different seasons with the same surface temperature. Based on offline radiative calculations, in the tropics OLR loops are mainly caused by seasonal variations in relative humidity that are out of phase with surface temperature; in the extratropics, OLR loops are mainly due to variations in lapse rates. Our work provides a mechanism through which Earth's climate feedback can differ between seasonal and long‐term time scales.
          , 
            Plain Language Summary
            When the Earth is warmer, it loses more heat to space. The simplest formula describing this relationship is a line with an upwards slope, where the slope determines how much Earth warms from added greenhouse gases. Here, we report that the relationship between local temperature and rate of heat loss to space can be more complicated on seasonal time scales, often taking the form of loops or other curved shapes. We come up with a way to measure how big these loops are, and explain why they happen. Our results underline that Earth's response to seasonal changes is generally different from Earth's response to global warming.

                  Monthly outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is a multivalued function of local surface temperature, exhibiting loops and other complex shapes
                
                
                  OLR loops occur both in clear‐sky and all‐sky data, so the behavior is robust to clouds
                
                
                  OLR loops arise because humidity lags surface temperature in the tropics, and lapse rates lead to surface temperature in the extratropics},

Compared to a mass-flux convection parameterization, a simplified convection adjustment parameterization leads to a {$>$}60\% decrease of the cloud albedo, increasing the mean dayside temperature by . The representation of convection also affects the atmospheric conditions of the night side, via a change in planetary-scale wave patterns. As a result, using the convection adjustment scheme makes the nightside cold traps warmer by 17\textendash 36 K for the planets in our simulations. The day\textendash night thermal contrast is sensitive to the representation of convection in 3D GCM simulations, so caution should be taken when interpreting emission phase curves. The choice of convection treatment, however, does not alter the simulated climate enough to result in a departure from habitable conditions, at least for the atmospheric composition and planetary parameters used in our study. The near-surface conditions both in the Trappist-1e and Proxima b cases remain temperate, allowing for an active water cycle. We further advance our analysis using high-resolution model experiments, in which atmospheric convection is simulated explicitly. Our results suggest that in a hypothetical global convection-permitting simulation, the surface temperature contrast would be higher than in the coarse-resolution simulations with parameterized convection. In other words, models with parameterized convection may overestimate the inter-hemispheric heat redistribution efficiency.},

Despite this focus, known EGPs populate a continuum of orbital separations from canonical hot Jupiter values (0.03\textendash 0.05 AU) out to 1 AU and beyond. Unlike typical hot Jupiters, these more distant EGPs will not generally be synchronously rotating. In anticipation of observations of this population, we here present three-dimensional atmospheric circulation models exploring the dynamics that emerge over a broad range of rotation rates and incident stellar fluxes appropriate for warm and hot Jupiters. We find that the circulation resides in one of two basic regimes. On typical hot Jupiters, the strong day\textendash night heating contrast leads to a broad, fast superrotating (eastward) equatorial jet and large day\textendash night temperature differences. At faster rotation rates and lower incident fluxes, however, the day\textendash night heating gradient becomes less important, and baroclinic instabilities emerge as a dominant player, leading to eastward jets in the midlatitudes, minimal temperature variations in longitude, and, often, weak winds at the equator. Our most rapidly rotating and least irradiated models exhibit similarities to Jupiter and Saturn, illuminating the dynamical continuum between hot Jupiters and the weakly irradiated giant planets of our own solar system. We present infrared (IR) light curves and spectra of these models, which depend significantly on incident flux and rotation rate. This provides a way to identify the regime transition in future observations. In some cases, IR light curves can provide constraints on the rotation rate of nonsynchronously rotating planets.},

Recent studies show that some hot-Jupiter exoplanets have much weaker water absorption features in their near-infrared spectra than predicted. The low amplitude of water signatures could be explained by very low water abundances, which may be a sign that water was depleted in the protoplanetary disk at the planet's formation location, but it is unclear whether this level of depletion can actually occur. Alternatively, these weak signals could be the result of obscuration by clouds or hazes, as found in some optical spectra. Here we report results from a comparative study of ten hot Jupiters covering the wavelength range 0.3-5 micrometres, which allows us to resolve both the optical scattering and infrared molecular absorption spectroscopically. Our results reveal a diverse group of hot Jupiters that exhibit a continuum from clear to cloudy atmospheres. We find that the difference between the planetary radius measured at optical and infrared wavelengths is an effective metric for distinguishing different atmosphere types. The difference correlates with the spectral strength of water, so that strong water absorption lines are seen in clear-atmosphere planets and the weakest features are associated with clouds and hazes. This result strongly suggests that primordial water depletion during formation is unlikely and that clouds and hazes are the cause of weaker spectral signatures.},

  abstract = {Abstract The role of planetary rotation in limiting the extent of the cross-equatorial solsticial Hadley cell (SHC) is investigated using idealized simulations with an aquaplanet general circulation model run under perpetual-solstice conditions. Consistent with previous studies that include a seasonal cycle, the SHC extent increases with decreasing rotation rate, and it occupies the entire globe for sufficiently low planetary rotation rates. A simple theory for the summer-hemisphere extent of the SHC is constructed in which it is assumed that the SHC occupies regions for which a hypothetical radiative\textendash convective equilibrium state is physically unattainable. The theory predicts that the SHC extends farther into the summer hemisphere as the rotation rate is decreased, qualitatively reproducing the behavior of the simulations, but it generally underestimates the simulated SHC extent. A diagnostic theory for the summer-hemisphere SHC extent is then developed based on the assumptions of slantwise convective neutrality and conservation of angular momentum within the Hadley cell. The theory relates the structure of the SHC in the summer hemisphere to the distribution of boundary layer entropy in the dynamically equilibrated simulations. The resultant diagnostic for the SHC extent generalizes the convective quasi-equilibrium-based constraint of Priv\'e and Plumb, in which the position of rain belts is related to maxima in the low-level entropy distribution.},

Only satellite observations provide a continuous survey of the state of the atmosphere over the entire globe and across the wide range of spatial and temporal scales that compose weather and climate variability. Satellite cloud data records now exceed more than 25 years; however, climate data records must be compiled from different satellite datasets and can exhibit systematic biases. Questions therefore arise as to the accuracy and limitations of the various sensors and retrieval methods. The Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Cloud Assessment, initiated in 2005 by the GEWEX Radiation Panel (GEWEX Data and Assessment Panel since 2011), provides the first coordinated intercomparison of publicly available, standard global cloud products (gridded monthly statistics) retrieved from measurements of multispectral imagers (some with multiangle view and polarization capabilities), IR sounders, and lidar. Cloud properties under study include cloud amount, cloud height (in terms of pressure, temperature, or altitude), cloud thermodynamic phase, and cloud radiative and bulk microphysical properties (optical depth or emissivity, effective particle radius, and water path). Differences in average cloud properties, especially in the amount of high-level clouds, are mostly explained by the inherent instrument measurement capability for detecting and/or identifying optically thin cirrus, especially when overlying low-level clouds. The study of long-term variations with these datasets requires consideration of many factors. The monthly gridded database presented here facilitates further assessments, climate studies, and the evaluation of climate models.},

  abstract = {Planets with nonzero obliquity and/or orbital eccentricity experience seasonal variations of stellar irradiation at local latitudes. The extent of the atmospheric response can be crudely estimated by the ratio of the orbital timescale to the atmospheric radiative timescale. Given a set of atmospheric parameters, we show that this ratio depends mostly on the stellar properties and is independent of orbital distance and planetary equilibrium temperature. For Jupiter-like atmospheres, this ratio is {$\ll$}1 for planets around very low mass M dwarfs and {$\greaterequivlnt$}1 when the stellar mass is greater than about 0.6 solar mass. Complications can arise from various factors, including varying atmospheric metallicity, clouds, and atmospheric dynamics. Given the eccentricity and obliquity, the seasonal response is expected to be systematically weaker for gaseous exoplanets around low-mass stars and stronger for those around more massive stars. The amplitude and phase lag of atmospheric seasonal variations as a function of host stellar mass are quantified by idealized analytic models. At the infrared emission level in the photosphere, the relative amplitudes of thermal flux and temperature perturbations are negligible, and their phase lags are closed to -90\textdegree{} for Jupiter-like planets around very low mass stars. The relative amplitudes and phase lags increase gradually with increasing stellar mass. With a particular stellar mass, the relative amplitude and phase lag decrease from low- to high-infrared optical depth. We also present numerical calculations for a better illustration of the seasonal behaviors. Last, we discuss implications for the atmospheric circulation and future atmospheric characterization of exoplanets in systems with different stellar masses.},

  abstract = {Abstract A hierarchy of zonally averaged atmospheric models is used to study the role of mean meridional motions and large-scale eddies in determining the zonal climate. Five models are developed: a radiative-convective equilibrium model (no large-scale motion), a zonally uniform model (no longitudinal asymmetries), an energy balance model (parameterized energy transport), a model that combines the physics of the two previous models, and a full statistical-dynamic model (with parameterizations of eddy momentum transport as well as eddy sensible heat transport). In the most complete model, the zonally averaged primitive equations are solved after parameterizing the eddies, friction and the diabatic heating rates. All the models have two layers in the vertical and a latitudinal grid resolution of 5\textdegree. For simplicity, we treat a ``dry earth'' case and calculate annual-average equilibrium states with each of the five models. We find that in the tropics a parameterized energy transport commonly used in energy balance models does not accurately simulate the energy transport as determined by an explicit calculation of the Hadley cell. The explicitly calculated Hadley transport is generally greater than the parameterized transport and leads to very small horizontal temperature gradients in the tropics. The strength of the Hadley cell is determined by both the local heating distribution and extratropical heat and momentum transport by the eddies. The extratropical mean meridional motions are primarily driven by the requirements of the momentum budget. An indirect (Ferrel) cell appears only when eddy momentum transport is included in the model.},

Here we explore the effects of the last of these, the Newtonian gravitational acceleration, on its atmosphere and climate. We first demonstrate that, if the atmosphere obeys the hydrostatic primitive equations, which are a very good approximation for most terrestrial atmospheres, and if the radiative forcing is unaltered, changes in gravity have no effect at all on the circulation except for a vertical rescaling. That is to say, the effects of gravity may be completely scaled away and the circulation is unaltered. However, if the atmosphere contains a dilute condensible that is radiatively active, such as water or methane, then an increase in gravity will generally lead to a cooling of the planet because the total path length of the condensible will be reduced as gravity increases, leading to a reduction in the greenhouse effect. Furthermore, the specific humidity will decrease, leading to changes in the moist adiabatic lapse rate, in the Equator-to-Pole heat transport, and in the surface energy balance because of changes in the sensible and latent fluxes. These effects are all demonstrated both by theoretical arguments and by numerical simulations with moist and dry general circulation models.},

Best estimates of the main energy components involved in radiative transfer and energy flows through the climate system do not satisfy physical constraints for conservation of energy without adjustments. The main issues relate to the downwelling longwave (LW) radiation and the hydrological cycle, and thus the surface evaporative cooling. It is argued that the discrepancy is 18\% of the surface latent energy flux, but only 4\% of the downwelling LW flux and, for various reasons, it is most likely that the latter is astray in some calculations, including many models, although there is also scope for precipitation estimates to be revised. Beginning in 2000, the top-of-atmosphere radiation measurements provide stable estimates of the net global radiative imbalance changes over a decade, but after 2004 there is ``missing energy'' as the observing system of the changes in ocean heat content, melting of land ice, and so on is unable to account for where it has gone. Based upon a number of climate model experiments for the twenty-first century where there are stases in global surface temperature and upper ocean heat content in spite of an identifiable global energy imbalance, we infer that the main sink of the missing energy is likely the deep ocean below 275~m depth.},

Differences from expectations constrain atmospheric circulation models, revealing factors that best match observations, including the roles of surface and subsurface reservoirs. The preference for clouds at mid-northern latitudes rather than near the pole is consistent with models that include widespread polar near-surface methane reservoirs in addition to the lakes and seas, suggesting a broader subsurface methane table is accessible to the atmosphere.},

A series of controlled experiments is conducted by varying planetary rotation rate and imposed equator-to-pole temperature difference. These defining parameters are combined further with each other into dimensionless forms to establish a parameter space in which the occurrences of different circulation regimes are mapped and classified. Clear, coherent trends are found when varying planetary rotation rate (thermal Rossby number) and frictional and thermal relaxation time-scales. The sequence of circulation regimes as a function of parameters, such as the planetary rotation rate, strongly resembles that obtained in laboratory experiments on rotating, stratified flows, especially if a topographic {$\beta$}-effect is included in those experiments to emulate the planetary vorticity gradients in an atmosphere induced by the spherical curvature of the planet. A regular baroclinic wave regime is also obtained at intermediate values of thermal Rossby number and its characteristics and dominant zonal wavenumber depend strongly on the strength of radiative and frictional damping. These regular waves exhibit some strong similarities to baroclinic storms observed on Mars under some conditions. Multiple jets are found at the highest rotation rates, when the Rossby deformation radius and other eddy-related length-scales are much smaller than the radius of the planet. These exhibit some similarity to the multiple zonal jets observed on gas giant planets. Jets form on a scale comparable to the most energetic eddies and the Rhines scale poleward of the supercritical latitude. The balance of heat transport varies strongly with {$\Omega{_\ast}$} between eddies and zonally symmetric flows, becoming weak with fast rotation.},

ROCKE-3D is an ongoing effort to expand the capabilities of ModelE2 to handle a broader range of atmospheric conditions, including higher and lower atmospheric pressures, more diverse chemistries and compositions, larger and smaller planet radii and gravity, different rotation rates (from slower to more rapid than modern Earth's, including synchronous rotation), diverse ocean and land distributions and topographies, and potential basic biosphere functions. The first aim of ROCKE-3D is to model planetary atmospheres on terrestrial worlds within the solar system such as paleo-Earth, modern and paleo-Mars, paleo-Venus, and Saturn's moon Titan. By validating the model for a broad range of temperatures, pressures, and atmospheric constituents, we can then further expand its capabilities to those exoplanetary rocky worlds that have been discovered in the past, as well as those to be discovered in the future.

  abstract = {Earth is unique among the planets of the solar system in possessing a full hydrological cycle. The role of water in the evolution of planetary atmospheres is discussed. As the atmospheres of the planets developed and modified the early climates of the planets, only the climate trajectory of Earth intercepted the water phase transitions near the triple point of water, thus allowing the full gamut of water forms to coexist. As a result, transitions between the water phases pervade the entire system and probably are responsible for the creation of a unique climate state. The interactions between the components of the climate system are enriched by the nonlinearity of the water phase transitions. The nonlinear character of the phase transitions of water suggests that the climate should be particularly sensitive to hydrological processes, especially in the tropics. Signatures of the nonlinearity are found in both the structure of the oceans and the atmosphere. Specific processes that determine the character of ocean-atmosphere interaction, including the role of ambient water vapor and clouds, the selective absorption of radiation by the ocean, the distribution of total heating in the ocean-atmosphere system, and the role of the flux of freshwater, are discussed in detail. Models of the ocean and atmospheric and oceanic data and models of the coupled system are used to perform systematic analyses of hydrological processes and their role in system interaction. The analysis is extended to consider the role of hydrological processes in the basic dynamics and thermodynamics of oceanic and atmospheric systems. The role hydrological processes play in determining the scale of the major atmospheric circulation patterns is investigated. Explanations are offered as to why large-scale convection in the tropical atmosphere is constrained to lie within the 28\textdegree C sea surface temperature contour and how hydrological processes are involved in interannual climate variability. The relative roles of thermal and haline forcing of the oceanic thermohaline circulation are discussed. Hydrological processes are considered in a global context by the development of a conceptual model of a simple planetary system. The constancy and maintenance of the very warm tropical sea surface temperatures are seen to be critical for the stability of climate. However, within the confines of the simplicity of the theory, the climate system, dominated by hydrological processes, conspires to maintain the temperature of the tropical warm pools.},

  abstract = {Abstract We seek the formative processes of the planetary circulations of Jupiter and Saturn. The study concentrates on examining whether processes known to control the terrestrial circulation, namely, two-dimensional turbulence and baroclinic instability, can produce Jovian circulations under Jovian conditions. The first numerical model involves a spherical barotropic vorticity equation subjected to a stochastic representation of baroclinic processes. The resulting solutions suggest that a strong affinity exists between the Jovian and terrestrial circulations. This leads to a reevaluation of terrestrial circulation theory from the broader perspective of parameter space. The solutions in the Jovian regime support the hypothesis that a variation of the Rhines effect\textemdash an interaction of the two-dimensional turbulence cascade and Rossby wave propagation\textemdash creates the pseudoaxisymmetry and scale L{$\beta$}={$\pi$}(2U/{$\beta$}){$\frac{1}{2}$} of the bands (U is the rms zonal velocity, and {$\beta$} the northward gradient of the Coriolis force). The anisotropy of the interaction produces zonally oriented flows, composed of a series of alternating easterly and westerly jets, between which lie characteristic ovals. Equatorial jets occur readily when vorticity sources that lie symmetrically about the equator act on the atmosphere. Frictionally induced Ekman circulations provide a possible mechanism for cloud formation. Integrations with terrestrial parameters support Kuo's (1951) forced vorticity-transfer theory for the Earth's circulation: westerly jets form in the forced midlatitude zones, and Rossby-wave propagation from those zones causes the broad easterly trade winds. Enstrophy cascade and {$\beta$} effects control the formation of momentum converging eddy patterns. L{$\beta$} also provides a measure of the width of the terrestrial jet. Cascade blocking by a stronger surface drag prevents terrestrial flows from approaching the same degree of zonality as Jovian ones. Jupiter also appears to be dynamically equivalent to a hypothetical (or primeval) global ocean that has neither continental boundaries nor surface winds.},

  abstract = {Rocky planets are common around other stars, but their atmospheric properties remain largely unconstrained. Thanks to a wealth of recent planet discoveries and upcoming advances in observing capability, we are poised to characterize the atmospheres of dozens of rocky exoplanets in this decade. The theoretical understanding of rocky exoplanet atmospheres has advanced considerably in the last few years, yielding testable predictions of their evolution, chemistry, dynamics, and even possible biosignatures. We review key progress in this field to date and discuss future objectives. Our major conclusions are as follows: {$\blacksquare$} Many rocky planets may form with initial H2\textendash He envelopes that are later lost to space, likely due to a combination of stellar UV/X-ray irradiation and internal heating. {$\blacksquare$} After the early stages of evolution, a wide diversity of atmospheric compositions is expected as a result of variations in host star flux, atmospheric escape rates, interior exchange, and other factors. {$\blacksquare$} Observations have ruled out both the presence of H2-dominated atmospheres on several nearby rocky exoplanets and the presence of any thick atmosphere on one target. A more detailed atmospheric characterization of these planets and others will become possible in the near future. {$\blacksquare$} Exoplanet biosphere searches are an exciting future goal. However, reliable detections for a representative sample of planets will require further advances in observing capability and improvements in our understanding of abiotic planetary processes.},

  abstract = {The habitable zone (HZ) is the circumstellar region where a planet can sustain surface liquid water. Searching for terrestrial planets in the HZ of nearby stars is the stated goal of ongoing and planned extrasolar planet surveys. Previous estimates of the inner edge of the HZ were based on one-dimensional radiative-convective models. The most serious limitation of these models is the inability to predict cloud behavior. Here we use global climate models with sophisticated cloud schemes to show that due to a stabilizing cloud feedback, tidally locked planets can be habitable at twice the stellar flux found by previous studies. This dramatically expands the HZ and roughly doubles the frequency of habitable planets orbiting red dwarf stars. At high stellar flux, strong convection produces thick water clouds near the substellar location that greatly increase the planetary albedo and reduce surface temperatures. Higher insolation produces stronger substellar convection and therefore higher albedo, making this phenomenon a stabilizing climate feedback. Substellar clouds also effectively block outgoing radiation from the surface, reducing or even completely reversing the thermal emission contrast between dayside and nightside. The presence of substellar water clouds and the resulting clement surface conditions will therefore be detectable with the James Webb Space Telescope.},

  abstract = {Planetary rotation rate is a key parameter in determining atmospheric circulation and hence the spatial pattern of clouds. Since clouds can exert a dominant control on planetary radiation balance, rotation rate could be critical for determining the mean planetary climate. Here we investigate this idea using a three-dimensional general circulation model with a sophisticated cloud scheme. We find that slowly rotating planets (like Venus) can maintain an Earth-like climate at nearly twice the stellar flux as rapidly rotating planets (like Earth). This suggests that many exoplanets previously believed to be too hot may actually be habitable, depending on their rotation rate. The explanation for this behavior is that slowly rotating planets have a weak Coriolis force and long daytime illumination, which promotes strong convergence and convection in the substellar region. This produces a large area of optically thick clouds, which greatly increases the planetary albedo. In contrast, on rapidly rotating planets a much narrower belt of clouds form in the deep tropics, leading to a relatively low albedo. A particularly striking example of the importance of rotation rate suggested by our simulations is that a planet with modern Earth's atmosphere, in Venus' orbit, and with modern Venus' (slow) rotation rate would be habitable. This would imply that if Venus went through a runaway greenhouse, it had a higher rotation rate at that time.},

  abstract = {Robustly modeling the inner edge of the habitable zone is essential for determining the most promising potentially habitable exoplanets for atmospheric characterization. Global climate models (GCMs) have become the standard tool for calculating this boundary, but divergent results have emerged among the various GCMs. In this study, we perform an intercomparison of standard GCMs used in the field on a rapidly rotating planet receiving a G-star spectral energy distribution and on a tidally locked planet receiving an M-star spectral energy distribution. Experiments both with and without clouds are examined. We find relatively small difference (within 8 K) in global-mean surface temperature simulation among the models in the G-star case with clouds. In contrast, the global-mean surface temperature simulation in the M-star case is highly divergent (20\textendash 30 K). Moreover, even differences in the simulated surface temperature when clouds are turned off are significant. These differences are caused by differences in cloud simulation and/or radiative transfer, as well as complex interactions between atmospheric dynamics and these two processes. For example we find that an increase in atmospheric absorption of shortwave radiation can lead to higher relative humidity at high altitudes globally and, therefore, a significant decrease in planetary radiation emitted to space. This study emphasizes the importance of basing conclusions about planetary climate on simulations from a variety of GCMs and motivates the eventual comparison of GCM results with terrestrial exoplanet observations to improve their performance.},

	abstract = {We generalize the theory of the inhomogeneity effect to enable comparison among different inhomogeneous planets. A metric of inhomogeneity based on the cumulative distribution function is applied to investigate the dependence of planetary cooling on previously overlooked parameters. The mean surface temperature of airless planets increases with rotational rate and surface thermal inertia, which bounds the value in the tidally locked configuration and the equilibrium temperature. Using an analytical model, we demonstrate that the internal heat flux of giant planets exhibits significant spatial variability, primarily emitted from the nightside and high-latitude regions acting as ``radiator fins." Given a horizontally uniform interior temperature in the convective zone, the outgoing internal flux increases up to several folds as the inhomogeneity of the incoming stellar flux increases. The enhancement decreases with increasing heat redistribution through planetary dynamics or rotation. The outgoing internal flux on rapidly rotating planets generally increases with planetary obliquity and orbital eccentricity. The radiative timescale and true anomaly of the vernal equinox also play significant roles. If the radiative timescale is long, the outgoing internal flux shows a slightly decreasing but nonlinear trend with obliquity. Our findings indicate that rotational and orbital states greatly influence the cooling of planets and impact the interior evolution of giant planets, particularly for tidally locked planets and planets with high eccentricity and obliquity (such as Uranus), as well as the spatial and temporal variations of their cooling fluxes.},
